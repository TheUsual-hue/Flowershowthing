# Dromaar

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Heritages/Versatile Heritages/Dromaar]]






Orcish strength emboldens your bloodline. You have a green tinge to your skin and other indicators of orc heritage. You gain the orc trait, the dromaar trait, and low-light vision. When you gain an ancestry feat, you can choose from dromaar and orc feats in addition to those from your ancestry.
