# Dhampir

### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Heritages/Versatile Heritages/Dhampir]]






You are the scion of a vampire, half living and half undead, gifted with uncanny charm and grace, a bloodless pallor, and elongated incisors. You gain the dhampir trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You have the void healing ability, which means you are harmed by vitality damage and healed by void effects as if you were undead. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can select from dhampir feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
