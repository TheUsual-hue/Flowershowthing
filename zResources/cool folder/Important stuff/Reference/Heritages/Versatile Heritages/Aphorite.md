You were born with a connection to Axis, the Plane of Law. You gain the aphorite trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from aphorite feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
