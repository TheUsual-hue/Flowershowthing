# Elusive Vishkanya

### 






Your flexible body seems unnaturally fluid to some, though they can rarely put a finger on what seems strange about you. You can escape foes with ease. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Escape|Escape]]. Additionally, you move twice as fast when Squeezing.
