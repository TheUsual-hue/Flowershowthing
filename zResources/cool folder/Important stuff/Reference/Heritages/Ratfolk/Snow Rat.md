# Snow Rat

### 






You have a thicker coat and bulkier frame to defend against the cold, granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
