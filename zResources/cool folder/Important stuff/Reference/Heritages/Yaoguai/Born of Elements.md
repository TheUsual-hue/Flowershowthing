# Born of Elements

### [[Yaoguai]]






You were an aspect of nature—the rain, the wind, a ray of light—until the wild essences gave you a soul. Due to your natural connection, the tradition of any spells or magical abilities you gain from a yaoguai heritage or ancestry feat is primal instead of its normal tradition (usually occult).

*   **Humanoid Form** You remain attuned to the natural world. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to [[Sense Direction|Sense Direction]], and you don't take a penalty if you don't have a compass.
*   **Yaoguai Form** The power of nature flows through you, ready to lash out. Choose [[Electric Arc|Electric Arc]], [[Frostbite|Frostbite]], [[Ignition|Ignition]], [[Needle Darts|Needle Darts]], [[Timber|Timber]], [[Scatter Scree|Scatter Scree]], [[Slashing Gust|Slashing Gust]], or [[Spout|Spout]]. You can cast this spell as an innate primal cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
