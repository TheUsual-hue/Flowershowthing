# Shifting Skeleton

### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")






Constructed from the bones of various shapechanging creatures, shifting skeletons retain a measure of reconfigurability, allowing them to shift forms. You gain the [[Rearrange Bones|Rearrange Bones]] action.
