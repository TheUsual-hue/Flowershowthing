# Shapewrought Fleshwarp

### 






A victim of fleshwarping, you likely bear loose flesh, bony spurs, or features of inhuman creatures sprouting from your skin. You have nevertheless turned the psychic toll of your transformation into a strength. You gain resistance to mental damage equal to half your level (minimum 1).
