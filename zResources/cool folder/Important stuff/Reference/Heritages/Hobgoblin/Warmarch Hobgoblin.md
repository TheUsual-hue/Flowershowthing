# Warmarch Hobgoblin

### 






You come from a line of wandering mercenaries constantly on the march and scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but don't critically fail, to [[Subsist|Subsist]] in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When exploring, you can [[Hustle|Hustle]] twice as long before you have to stop.
