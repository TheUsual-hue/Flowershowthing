# Warrenbred Hobgoblin

### 






Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. While you're underground, when you target an opponent that is [[Concealed|Concealed]] from you or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to [[Squeeze|Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
