# Dark Fields Kitsune

### 






You can exert your unsettling presence to subtly Demoralize others. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the [[Invigorating Fear|Invigorating Fear]] reaction. Your alternate form is a fox, which has the statistics of 1st-rank [[Pest Form|Pest Form]].
