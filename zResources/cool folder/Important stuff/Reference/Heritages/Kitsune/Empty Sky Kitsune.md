# Empty Sky Kitsune

### 






Your spirit is open to the secrets of beyond, granting you greater access to kitsune magic. You gain the [[Kitsune Spell Familiarity|Kitsune Spell Familiarity]] ancestry feat. Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human), called a tailless form.
