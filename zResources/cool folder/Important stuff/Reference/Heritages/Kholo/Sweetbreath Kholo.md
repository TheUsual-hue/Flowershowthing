# Sweetbreath Kholo

### 






You're a striped, pale-furred kholo with oddly pleasant breath, which you can use to entrance your prey. You are trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] if the target can smell your breath.
