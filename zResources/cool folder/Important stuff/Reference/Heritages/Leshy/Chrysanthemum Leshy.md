# Chrysanthemum Leshy

### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/leshy]]






You look like a human child, though with a grand crown of chrysanthemums growing from your head, ornate as an emperor's. These petals have medicinal properties, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against poison.

Furthermore, during your daily preparations, you can harmlessly pluck a few petals from your head and steep them in fresh water to create a single [[Equipment/Antidote (Lesser)|Lesser Antidote]], which takes the form of a tea. At level 6, you instead create a [[Antidote (Moderate)|Moderate Antidote]]; at level 10, a [[Antidote (Greater)|Greater Antidote]]; and at level 14, a [[Antidote (Major)|Major Antidote]]. The tea loses its effectiveness if not consumed before your next daily preparations.
