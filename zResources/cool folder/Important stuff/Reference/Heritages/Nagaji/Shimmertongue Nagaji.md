# Shimmertongue Nagaji

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/nagaji]]






You were born with a keen sense for magic, able to taste its unique effects in the air. You gain magicsense as a vague sense that has a range of 30 feetâ€”like all vague senses, it's only about as precise as an average human's sense of smell, meaning you generally can predict only if magic is present; however, each tradition of magic has a unique taste to you, allowing you to identify the tradition of magic present.
