# Whisper Elf

### 






Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest whispers of sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [[Seek|Seek]] action to find [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creatures within 30 feet of you. When you target an opponent that is [[Concealed|Concealed]] from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. This benefit doesn't apply if you can't hear or if the creature is incapable of making sound (for example, if it's affected by a [[Silence|Silence]] spell).
