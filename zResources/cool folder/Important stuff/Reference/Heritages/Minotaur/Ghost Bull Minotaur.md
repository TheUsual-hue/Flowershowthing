# Ghost Bull Minotaur

### 






Your fur is as pale as death, possibly from some connection you or your family has to the afterlife, which lets you supernaturally find your way. You can cast [[Know the Way|Know the Way]] as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus against spells or effects that cause the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] condition.
