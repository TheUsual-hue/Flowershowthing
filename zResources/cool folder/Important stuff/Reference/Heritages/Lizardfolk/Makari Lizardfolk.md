# Makari Lizardfolk

### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/lizardfolk]]






You have a trunk-like snout and a connection to the divine. The tradition of any spells or magical abilities you gain from a lizardfolk heritage or ancestry feat is divine instead of its normal tradition (usually primal).

You gain your choice of the [[Divine Lance|Divine Lance]] or [[Forbidding Ward|Forbidding Ward]] cantrips, which you can cast as a divine innate cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. When you cast this cantrip, it loses the manipulate trait, as you cast purely by roaring and flaring your trunk.
