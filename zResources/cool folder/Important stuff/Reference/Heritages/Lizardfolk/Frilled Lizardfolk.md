# Frilled Lizardfolk

### 






You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, Demoralizing your foes. When you do, [[Demoralize|Demoralize]] loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the [[Threatening Approach|Threatening Approach]] action.
