# Jinxed Halfling

### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






You were born with a strange blessing: bereft of the typical halfling luck, you can instead manipulate the fortunes of others. You can never take the [[Halfling Luck|Halfling Luck]] feat, and you gain the [[Jinx|Jinx]] action.
