# Mightyfall Kobold

### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/kobold]]






Your proximity to a mighty kaiju has caused you to grow strong and hardy. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 6. Instead of the normal attribute boosts and flaws, you can choose to gain a boost to Strength, a boost to Charisma, and a flaw in Intelligence.
