You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] and to Perception DCs against attempts to [[Lie|Lie]] to you.

Furthermore, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to convince others you speak the truth when you are telling the truth, and you take a -4 circumstance penalty to lie and to your Deception DC against [[Sense Motive|Sense Motive]].
