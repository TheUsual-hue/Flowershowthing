# Rock Dwarf

### 






Your ancestors lived and worked among the ancient stones of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This makes you solid as a rock when you plant your feet. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Reposition|Reposition]], [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to force you to move or knock you [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

In addition, if any effect would force you to move 10 feet or more, you are moved only half the distance.
