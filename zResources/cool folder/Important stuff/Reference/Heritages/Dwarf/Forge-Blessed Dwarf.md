# Forge-Blessed Dwarf

### 






You are from a family in Highhelm that venerates a particular dwarven deity above all others. Your birth was blessed by your family's patron deity, granting you a fraction of their power. Choose one deity from the dwarven pantheon. You can cast the 1st-rank spell they grant clerics (such as [[Soothe|Soothe]] if your family's patron is Bolka) as an innate divine spell once per week.
