# Shadow of the Courtier

### [[Wayang]]






Your shadow dances alongside you. You gain the Impressive Performance skill feat, allowing you to [[Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] using Performance instead of Diplomacy. Once per day, if you fail, but not critically fail, a check to Make an Impression, you can play it off as part of a performance, allowing you to reroll the check; this is a fortune effect.
