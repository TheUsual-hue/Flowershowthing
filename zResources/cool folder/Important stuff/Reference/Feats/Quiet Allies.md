# Quiet Allies
## Feat 2
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/general]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Stealth
* * *
You're skilled at moving with a group. When you are [[Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]] and your allies [[Follow the Expert|Follow the Expert]], you and those allies can roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately. This doesn't apply for initiative rolls.
