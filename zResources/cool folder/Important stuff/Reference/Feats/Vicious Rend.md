# Vicious Rend
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication; animal companion with a claw, fist, pincer, or talon unarmed attack
* * *
Your companion sinks its claws and rips. Your companions with a qualifying unarmed attack learn the Vicious Rend activity.

**Vicious Rend** `pf2:2` Make two claw, fist, pincer, or talon Strikes against the same target, applying the multiple attack penalty as normal. If both Strikes hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage. This damage increases to 2d6 if your companion is specialized.
