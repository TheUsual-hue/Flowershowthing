**Access** You are from the Eye of Dread region.

You've sworn yourself as a sentry for the Knights of Lastwall, the first line of defense against incursions by the Whispering Tyrant throughout Golarion. You become trained in Athletics and in Undead Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Finally, you gain the [[Reactive Shield|Reactive Shield]] fighter feat.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Lastwall Sentry|Lastwall Sentry]] archetype.
