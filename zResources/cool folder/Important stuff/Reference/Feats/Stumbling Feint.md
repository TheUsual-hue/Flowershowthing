# Stumbling Feint
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception; Stumbling Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Stumbling Stance|Stumbling Stance]].

* * *

You lash out confusingly with what seems to be a weak move but instead allows you to unleash a dangerous flurry of blows upon your unsuspecting foe.

When you use [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]], you can attempt a check to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Feint|Feint]] as a free action just before the first Strike.

On a success, instead of making the target [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your next attack, they become off-guard against both attacks from the Flurry of Blows.
