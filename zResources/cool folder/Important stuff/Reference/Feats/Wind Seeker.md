# Wind Seeker
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Animist]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Walk the Wilds
* * *
Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. You add [[Aerial Form|Aerial Form]] to your apparition spell repertoire, allowing you to cast it with your apparition spellcasting. Whenever you use _aerial form_ to gain a form that grants you a specific Acrobatics modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to Acrobatics checks.

* * *

**Special** If you are attuned to an apparition of darkened boughs, add the bat and bird forms in _aerial form_ to your [[Darkened Forest Form|Darkened Forest Form]] lists.
