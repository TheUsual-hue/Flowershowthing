# Saving Slash `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** An opponent critically hits you with a melee attack.

* * *

You quickly whirl your blade, trying to deflect enough momentum to avoid the worst of the attack. Attempt a DC 16 Flat check. If you succeed, the attack becomes a normal hit, instead of a critical hit.
