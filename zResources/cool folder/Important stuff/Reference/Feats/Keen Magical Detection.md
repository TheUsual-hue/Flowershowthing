# Keen Magical Detection
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/fortune]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Wizard]]

**Category** class; 




You sense magical dangers. When using the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the better result so long as at least one opponent has a magical effect or magic item and is in range of your [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]].
