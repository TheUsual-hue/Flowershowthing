# Steal Spell
## Feat 16
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/magical]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Legendary Thief; Loaner Spell
* * *
When you use [[Legendary Thief|Legendary Thief]] to steal the impossible, you can steal a prepared spell or spontaneous spell from a foe. The spell is randomly selected from the highest-rank spells the foe knows that have a target or area, to a maximum of 8th-rank spells; the target loses the appropriate spell slot as if they had cast it themself.

You can Cast the Spell once within the next 1d4 rounds, after which the fleeting magic fades; this otherwise works the same as casting a [[Loaner Spell|Loaner Spell]].
