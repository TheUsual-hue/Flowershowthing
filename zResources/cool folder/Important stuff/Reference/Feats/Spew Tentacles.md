# Spew Tentacles
## Feat 13
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/fleshwarp]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can open your mouth to an immense size and spew forth an impossibly large field of tentacles. You can cast [[Black Tentacles|Black Tentacles]] once per day as an innate occult spell, though when you do so, you spew them from your mouth out to the appropriate range, where they take root and begin Grappling creatures as usual. The tentacles recognize you as a part of them and don't attempt to Grapple you, even if you are in the area.
