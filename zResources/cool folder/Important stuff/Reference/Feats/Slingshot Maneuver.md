**Trigger** A willing ally enters a space within your lash's reach using a move action.

You spin your lash out for your ally to grab on to, giving them a boost to their movement. You move the ally 15 feet into a square of their choice that is within reach of your lash. If the ally has movement remaining, they can continue their movement after completing the Slingshot Maneuver.
