# Winter's Clutch `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/cold]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/impulse]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Kineticist]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/primal]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/water]]

**Category** class; 




Gleaming flakes of chilling snow fall in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes 2d4 cold damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC. The ground in the area is covered in a snow drift, which is difficult terrain. Each square of the drift lasts until it melts, either naturally or until fire damage is dealt in that square.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4.
