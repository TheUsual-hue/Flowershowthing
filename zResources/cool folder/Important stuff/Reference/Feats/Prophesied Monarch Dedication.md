# Prophesied Monarch Dedication
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/destiny]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 




Your Calling has culminated in a destiny of rulership, and you're able to forge a mythic bond with noble knights whose destinies become intertwined with your own. Designate up to five allies as your knights; as long as you're conscious, your knights' doomed condition can't rise above 3, and if they're ever in mortal peril (such as being [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] with the dying condition or imprisoned in an enemy fortress), you instantly receive a vision revealing their location and condition.

In addition, you gain the [[Royal Grace|Royal Grace]] exploration activity.
