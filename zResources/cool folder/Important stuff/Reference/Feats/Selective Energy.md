# Selective Energy
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Cleric]]

**Category** class; 




As you call down divine power, you can prevent some enemies from benefiting or some allies from being hurt. When you cast a version of [[Harm|Harm]] or [[Heal|Heal]] that has an area, you can designate up to 5 creatures in the area. They are not targeted by the spell.
