# Shared Assault
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Bard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Courageous Assault
* * *
In the triumph of battle, you can share the glory with another ally. When the ally you chose for [[Courageous Assault|Courageous Assault]] critically succeeds at the Strike granted by that action, another ally affected by your [[Courageous Anthem|Courageous Anthem]] composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make a melee Strike. This effect doesn't continue to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds.
