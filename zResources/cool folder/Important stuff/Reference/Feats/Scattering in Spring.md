# Scattering in Spring `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Twisting Petal Stance
* * *
**Trigger** An enemy within your reach targets you with a melee attack, and you're aware of the attack.

**Requirements** You're in [[Twisting Petal Stance|Twisting Petal Stance]].

* * *

You evade an incoming attack by twisting your enemy's tactics in your favor. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can immediately attempt a [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Feint|Feint]] or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]] against the triggering attacker; if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
