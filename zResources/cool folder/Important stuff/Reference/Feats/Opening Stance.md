# Opening Stance `pf2:0`
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You roll initiative.

At the first sign of trouble, often before you consciously realize the danger, you drop into a stance with a mere thought. Use an action that has the stance trait.
