# The Bitter Scholar's Promotion
## Feat 16
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghost-Path Epiphany
* * *
Tian Xia's shining cities belie its empires' long shadow of death, darkened by thousands of years of suffering and injustice. You pursue immortality not through tuft-hunting with Heaven's dragons or their imperial brats; yours is the power to crack its corrupt wheel, for you can now release the ghost gates to expedite the dead's revenge at being cheated of their fates.

You cease aging and, regardless of your actual existential state, now register as an undead to effects that can detect undead (such as lifesense or spiritsense).

In addition, you learn [[Create Undead|Create Undead]] rituals for [[Gashadokuro|Gashadokuro]], [[Provincial Jiang-shi|Jiang-shi]], and [[Lost Omens: Tian Xia World Guide/Shui Gui|Shui Gui]]. On a success with one of these rituals, you gain the effects of a critical success instead.
