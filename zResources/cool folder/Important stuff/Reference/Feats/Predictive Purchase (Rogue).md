# Predictive Purchase (Rogue)
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You somehow manage to have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [[Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] and [[Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] feats. When using Prescient Planner, you can draw the item from your backpack (or a similar container) as a 2-action activity, instead of taking 1 minute to do so.
