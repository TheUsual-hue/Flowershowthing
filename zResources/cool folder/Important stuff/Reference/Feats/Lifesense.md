# Lifesense
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/divine]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your psychopomp forebears. You gain lifesense as an imprecise sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the life force of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The sense can distinguish between the vitality energy animating living creatures and the void energy animating undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.
