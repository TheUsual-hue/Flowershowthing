# Rough Terrain Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/stance]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Geomancer Dedication; expert in Nature
* * *
**Requirements** You gained a terrain attunement benefit this turn.

* * *

You enter a stance that makes it difficult to move around you. Each square adjacent to you becomes difficult terrain that matches the terrain attunement you gained (rime forms in an arctic terrain, momentary undergrowth shoots up in a forest terrain, and so on). You ignore this difficult terrain.

This stance ends if you move into a different type of terrain.
