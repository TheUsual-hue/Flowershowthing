# Knock Sense `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Champion]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 




You attack carefully to knock some sense into a creature whose actions aren't their own. Make a Strike against a [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] ally. The Strike is nonlethal and doesn't take a -2 penalty for using a weapon without the nonlethal trait; if you hit and deal damage, your ally automatically succeeds at the flat check to remove the confused condition when taking damage.
