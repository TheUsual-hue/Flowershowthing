# Shore Step
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** wave order

The shallows and tide pools have always called to you and let you pass unhindered. You ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water.

In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to [[Balance|Balance]] on a slippery or wet surface, or on an Athletics check to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Swim|Swim]], you get a critical success instead.
