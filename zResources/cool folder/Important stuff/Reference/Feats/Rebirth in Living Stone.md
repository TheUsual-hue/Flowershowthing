You're immune to critical hits and precision damage. You can't be pushed, pulled, or tripped while you're standing on earth or stone. Your earth Elemental Blasts deal an additional 1d10 damage of their normal type. These benefits last until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain them up to 1 minute.
