# Living Monolith Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages; trained in Crafting
* * *
**Access** You are from the Golden Road region.

* * *

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a _ka stone_ that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent _ka stone_. If you fail a recovery check while dying, your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. You become trained in Ancient Osirion Lore, or expert if you were already trained.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Living Monolith|Living Monolith]] archetype.
