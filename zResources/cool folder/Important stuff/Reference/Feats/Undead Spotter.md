Your studies of the undead have taught you telltale signs of a disguised undead creature. When you [[Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] that involves a corpse or creature within your reach, you can touch that corpse or creature to immediately determine if it is undead. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks about undead creatures and to determine if a creature is undead.
