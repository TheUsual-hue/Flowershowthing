# Resurrectionist
## Feat 16
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Cleric]]

**Category** class; 




You can cause a creature you bring back from the brink of death to thrive and continue healing. When you restore Hit Points to a dying creature or bring a dead creature back to life and restore Hit Points to it, you grant that creature fast healing 5 for 1 minute. This fast healing ends if the creature is knocked [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]].
