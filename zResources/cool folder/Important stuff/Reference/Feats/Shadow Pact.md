# Shadow Pact
## Feat 13
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/human]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Nidalese ethnicity
* * *
Thousands of years ago, your ancestors made a pact with [[Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]]. He has not forgotten, even if you might wish he had. You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-rank [[Creation|Creation]] as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.
