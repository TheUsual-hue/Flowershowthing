**Prerequisites** Frighten Undead

Your very presence strikes fear into the undead. When you use [[Slayer's Identification|Slayer's Identification]] and succeed at your check, you can [[Frighten Undead|Frighten Undead]] as a free action, targeting the creature you identified. Any time you get a critical success to Frighten Undead, if the target's level is lower than yours, the target is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
