# Rites of Transfiguration
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Witch]]

**Category** class; 




You can adapt your patron's power to transform other creatures into forms more befitting their behavior or your whims. Your familiar learns [[Cursed Metamorphosis|Cursed Metamorphosis]], even if _cursed metamorphosis_ isn't on your tradition's spell list. By spending 10 minutes in communion with your familiar, you can replace one spell of 6th-rank or higher you've prepared in one of your witch spell slots with a cursed metamorphosis spell of the same rank.
