# Pelagic Aptitude
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/azarketi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned special tricks to survive underwater. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Survival.

When in an aquatic environment, if you roll a critical failure on a Survival skill check to [[Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or [[Subsist|Subsist]], you get a failure instead.
