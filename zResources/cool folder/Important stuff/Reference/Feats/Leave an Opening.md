# Leave an Opening
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Rogue]]

**Category** class; 




When you hit hard enough, you leave an opening so your ally can jump in on the action. Whenever you critically hit an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] opponent with a melee attack and deal damage, the target triggers a Reactive Strike reaction from one ally of your choice who has that reaction, as if the enemy had used a manipulate action.
