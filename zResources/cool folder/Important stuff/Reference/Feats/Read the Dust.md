# Read the Dust `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Investigator]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** an undead creature is reduced to zero Hit Points or a haunt is disabled within 60 feet of you

* * *

You watch the creature or hazard as it collapses, careful for any sign it may return. You immediately learn if the creature or hazard has an ability that will restore it, like rejuvenation or a haunt's reset.

If it can return, you also learn the time span before its return and how to prevent that return in broad terms, such as "lay its body to rest" or "destroy its armor." If this requires any people or objects that aren't already present, you also learn the direction towards each missing piece from the dust's movement.
