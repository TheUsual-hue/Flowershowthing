# Mythic Counter
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wildspell Dedication
* * *
You can overwhelm the magical designs of others with sheer magic power. When you attempt a counteract check against a spell, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. If the target of the counteract check is within your spellsurge aura, critical failures on this check are treated as failures.
