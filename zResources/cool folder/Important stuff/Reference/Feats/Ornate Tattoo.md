**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Arcane Tattoos

You expand your tattoos to encompass greater magic. Choose a 1st-rank arcane spell from the same school as your Arcane Tattoos, either a common spell or another to which you have access. You can cast that spell once per day as an innate arcane spell.
