# Unwavering Guide
## Feat 1
### [[Yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Sharp-eyed and sure-footed, your presence is a boon to those you guide. When you [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Scout|Scout]], you grant your party a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls instead of the normal +1. When your group uses the [[Hustle|Hustle]] activity, they can use your Constitution modifier to determine how fast the group can Hustle together, even if it isn't the lowest in the group.
