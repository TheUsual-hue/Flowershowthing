# Mated Birds in Paired Flight
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Exemplar]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/ikon]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued in one or two weapon ikons that both have the thrown trait (see text)

* * *

Your ikons bond like a pair of one-winged birds. This feat can be imbued in either a single ikon with multiple copies, such as one produced by the [[Shadow Sheath|Shadow Sheath]] or with the [[Twin Stars|Twin Stars]] feat, or two separate ikons (bypassing the normal limit per ikon feat).

**Immanence** As long as you hold one ikon, the other will return to find its partner. Both ikons gain the returning rune.

**Transcendenceâ€”**[[Rejoin in Flight|Rejoin in Flight]] `pf2:2` (transcendence)

[[Rejoin in Flight]]
