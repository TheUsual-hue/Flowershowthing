# Puncturing Horn
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/kashrishi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




While many kashrishi never use their horns for more than cracking open hard-shelled fruits or amplifying their psychic powers, you've practiced using yours offensively. You gain a horn unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your horn is in the brawling group and has the finesse and unarmed traits.

**Special** If you have the xyloshi heritage, your horn instead deals 1d8 piercing damage.
