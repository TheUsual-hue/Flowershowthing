# Rebel's Map `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Horizon Walker Dedication or Scout Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You roll initiative.

* * *

Rebellions require an intricate knowledge of one's surroundingsâ€”because you might need to escape at any moment. You remember the locations of escape routes, ambush spots, and cover from a scouting expedition or a previous visit to the area. Roll a d20. At any point during the subsequent combat, you can substitute the result of this roll instead of rolling a d20 on one Deception check to [[Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] or on one Stealth check to [[Hide|Hide]].
