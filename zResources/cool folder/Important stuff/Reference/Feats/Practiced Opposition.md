# Practiced Opposition `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lastwall Sentry Dedication
* * *
You've battled more undead than you care to remember, often with little time to prepare between foes, forcing you to rely on experience and muscle memory to guide your blade. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about an undead you can see and then Strike that undead. If your attempt to Recall Knowledge is successful, your Strike treats the target's resistances as 5 lower. The target is then immune to your Practiced Opposition for 24 hours.
