Gathering up threads of your old connection, you can temporarily disguise yourself as your missing patron. You gain [[Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] as an innate spell of your patron's tradition, automatically heightened to the rank of your witch cantrips, but you can use it only to disguise yourself as the humanoid representation of your patron. Detection spells of lower rank than this _illusory disguise_ give your patron's information rather than your own.
