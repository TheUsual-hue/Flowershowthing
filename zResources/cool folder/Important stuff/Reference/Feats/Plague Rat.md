Your bites carry a cursed infection. When you hit and deal damage to a creature with a jaws Strike while in hybrid or rat shape, the creature is cursed until the start of your next turn. Whenever they regain Hit Points during that time, they must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

**Success** The creature regains Hit Points normally.

**Failure** The creature regains half the normal Hit Points.

**Critical Failure** The creature regains no Hit Points.
