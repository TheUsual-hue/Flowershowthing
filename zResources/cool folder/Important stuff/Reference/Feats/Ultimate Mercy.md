# Ultimate Mercy
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mercy
* * *
Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death. Add ultimate mercy to the types of mercy you can provide. When you use [[Mercy|Mercy]], you can target a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. The target returns to life with 1 Hit Point and becomes [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]]. You can't return the target to life if it died from [[Disintegrate|Disintegrate]] or a death effect. The creature gains the other benefits of [[Lay on Hands|Lay on Hands]] after it returns to life.
