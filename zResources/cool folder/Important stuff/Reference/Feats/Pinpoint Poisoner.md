# Pinpoint Poisoner
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully Strike an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature with a poisoned weapon or expose an off-guard creature to an inhaled poison, that creature takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.
