# Scaly Hide
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were born with a layer of scales across your entire body that resemble those of your draconic progenitor. When you're unarmored, the scales give you a +2 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus to AC from these scales is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, the [[Mystic Armor|Mystic Armor]] spell, or [[Bands of Force|Bands of Force]].

**Special** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
