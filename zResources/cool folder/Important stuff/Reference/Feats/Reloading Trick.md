# Reloading Trick
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Drow Shootist Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You're holding an unloaded hand crossbow.

* * *

You can fire off a single shot even when unprepared. You Interact to reload your hand crossbow and Strike with it.

**Special** If you have the [[Repeating Hand Crossbow Training|Repeating Hand Crossbow Training]] feat, you can use this feat with a [[Equipment/Repeating Hand Crossbow|Repeating Hand Crossbow]] to load either a [[Bolts|Bolt]] or a [[Equipment/Repeating Hand Crossbow Magazine|Repeating Hand Crossbow Magazine]], but the speed means you can fire only one bolt, then the magazine jams. You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.
