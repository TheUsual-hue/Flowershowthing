# Lingering Breath
## Feat 17
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Breath of the Dragon
* * *
Your draconic breath destroys the surrounding environment and leaves your enemies in pain. When you use Breath of the Dragon, the area of your breath becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. In addition, a creature who fails or critically fails its saving throw takes 2d6 persistent damage of the same type.
