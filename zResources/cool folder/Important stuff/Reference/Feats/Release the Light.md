Many people report seeing a bright light before their death. You're one of these people, and at rare intervals when hope seems dim, the light exudes outward from your soul. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light for another 30 feet beyond that) until the end of your next turn. Enemy creatures in the area who rely on sight must attempt a Fortitude check save equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 2 rounds and dazzled for 1 minute.
