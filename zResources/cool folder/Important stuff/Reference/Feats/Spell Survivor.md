# Spell Survivor
## Feat 5
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Once you've resisted an opponent's magic, anything else they throw your way becomes less effective. When you attempt a saving throw against a spell using [[Orc Superstition|Orc Superstition]] or [[Pervasive Superstition|Pervasive Superstition]] and critically succeed, you gain resistance 1 to all damage dealt by that triggering spell's caster until the end of their next turn. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the resistance increases by 1.
