# Tandem Strike `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Summoner]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/tandem]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** A creature is in your and your eidolon's reach.

You and your eidolon each attack, seamlessly targeting the same foe without interfering with each other's movements. Your eidolon makes a melee Strike, and then you make a melee Strike against the same creature. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks have been made.
