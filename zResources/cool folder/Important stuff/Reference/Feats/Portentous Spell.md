**Category** class; 




Your spellcasting is rife with strange lights, mild fumes, and other captivating effects that befuddle your foes. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, any creature that attempts to use a reaction triggered by your Cast a Spell activity takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks rolled as part of the reaction.

In addition, if the spell includes a spell attack or requires a saving throw, creatures you hit or that fail their saves are [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with you until the start of your next turn.
