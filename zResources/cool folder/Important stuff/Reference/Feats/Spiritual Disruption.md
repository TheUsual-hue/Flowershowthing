# Spiritual Disruption `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Pyre
* * *
You channel disruptive power that severs a foe's spiritual connection to their heretical magic. Make a melee Strike. If the attack hits, any time the target attempts to cast a divine or occult spell, the spell is disrupted unless they succeed at a DC 5 Flat check (DC 7 Flat check on a critical hit); if the target is also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], it must attempt the harder of the two flat checks (but not both). This effect lasts for 1 minute.
