# Reaper of Repose
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Reclaimant Dedication; master proficiency in a weapon
* * *
Your skill and fervor allow you to pierce undead defenses and exploit their weaknesses. When you make an attack using a weapon with which you have master proficiency and hit an undead creature, you ignore 5 points of the creature's resistances, and the undead's weaknesses are 2 higher against your attack.
