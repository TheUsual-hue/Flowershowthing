### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You naturally adopt a pleasant and affable demeanor when meeting others. You are trained in Diplomacy. If you would automatically become trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

In addition, you gain the [[Hobnobber|Hobnobber]] skill feat.
