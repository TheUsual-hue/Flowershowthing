# Light-Bending Jewel
## Feat 13
### [[Sarangay]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your ability to walk unseen through the world has given you the new moon's blessing. Once per day, while you possess your head gem, you can cast either [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] or [[Translocate|Translocate]] as a 4th-rank innate occult spell.
