**Category** general; 



**Prerequisites** master in Perception

When you scout, you are particularly alert for danger, granting your allies precious moments to prepare to fight. When using the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Scout|Scout]] exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.
