**Category** class; 




A massive sphere of rock explodes, unleashing a cataclysm of falling debris and deadly shrapnel. Its destruction falls in a 20-foot burst within 120 feet. Creatures in the area take 9d10 bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude check save against your class DC. Those who fail are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. For the next minute, rocks continue to fall, making the area difficult terrain and dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage to any creature that ends its turn in the area. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends.

**Level (20th)** The initial damage is 10d10, and the area damage is 4d10.
