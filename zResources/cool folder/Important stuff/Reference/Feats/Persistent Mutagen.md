# Persistent Mutagen
## Feat 16
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Extend Elixir
* * *
You've trained your physical form to remain stable. Once per day, when you consume an alchemical item with the infused and mutagen traits, you can extend its duration to last until the next time you make your daily preparations instead of its normal duration. Unlike with the normal extension from [[Extend Elixir|Extend Elixir]], this can exceed the duration of an item created with [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] beyond its normal 10-minute limit.
