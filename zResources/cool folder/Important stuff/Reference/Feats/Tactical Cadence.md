# Tactical Cadence
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cadence Call
* * *
Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively, even in desperate situations. When you grant allies the [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action to either Stride or Strike, and they aren't [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] on their following turn if they use the extra action.
