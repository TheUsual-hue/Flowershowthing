### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Animist]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/apparition]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/aura]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/exploration]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Apparition Sense
* * *
Your allied apparitions ward you against the predations of their restless peers. You and allies in a 30-foot emanation gain a +2 status bonus to [[Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks about spirits, haunts, and undead. While you're [[Search|Searching]] or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Detect Magic|Detecting Magic]] in exploration mode, this bonus also applies to AC and saves against reactions any of you trigger from haunts and spirits. During your first turn in an encounter, you and allies in the aura have resistance equal to half your level against damage dealt by haunts or spirits.
