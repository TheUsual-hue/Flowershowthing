# Three Clear Breaths
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cultivator Dedication; Constitution +2
* * *
Through your disciplined condensations and circulations of qi, you've caught a fleeting glimpse of cultivation's promise, and your health has handsomely profited along the way. You gain the [[Breath Control|Breath Control]], [[Diehard|Diehard]], and [[Fast Recovery|Fast Recovery]] feats. You must meet the prerequisites for these feats as normal. For each of these feats you already have, you can instead gain a different feat from the following list: [[Canny Acumen|Canny Acumen]], [[Fleet|Fleet]], and [[Toughness|Toughness]].
