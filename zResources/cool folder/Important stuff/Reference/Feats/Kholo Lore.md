# Kholo Lore
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/gnoll]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You paid close attention to the senior hunters in your clan to learn their tricks. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Stealth and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Kholo Lore.
