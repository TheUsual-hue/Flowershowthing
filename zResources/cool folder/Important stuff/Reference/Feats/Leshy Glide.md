# Leshy Glide
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** leaf leshy heritage or Cat Fall skill feat
* * *
Using your own leaves, you can control your descent. You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and have not yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
