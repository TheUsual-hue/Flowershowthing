# Shatter Defenses `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/press]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** A frightened creature is in your melee reach.

* * *

Your offense exploits your enemy's fear. Make a melee Strike against a frightened creature. If you hit and deal damage, the target becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until its frightened condition ends. If the target was already off-guard to you when you damaged it with this Strike, it can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until the start of your next turn.
