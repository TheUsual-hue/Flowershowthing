**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** snaptongue tripkee
* * *
Your tongue can momentarily latch on as readily as your hands. So long as you can freely open your mouth, you do not need free hands in order to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]], [[Reposition|Reposition]], or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]]. If you have the [[Long Tongue|Long Tongue]] feat, you can Disarm, Grab an Edge, Reposition, and Trip with your tongue at a distance that is 5 feet beyond your normal reach.
