# Time Dilation Cascade `pf2:3`
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Ranger]]

**Category** class; 




You borrow a bit of time from the future to act now. Make six Strikes. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these Strikes. If you successfully hit a creature with multiple Strikes, combine those Strikes' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. On your next turn, you regain 1 action instead of 3. This is before any alteration in your actions due to the quickened, slowed, and stunned conditions.
