# Loyal Warhorse
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Faithful Steed
* * *
The loyalty you and your mount share is unbreakable. The mount you gained with Faithful Steed is now a mature animal companion. In addition, your mount never attacks you, even if it is magically compelled to do so.
