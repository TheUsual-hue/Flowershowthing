# Wing Buffet
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/attack]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Athletics
* * *
You have a pair of draconic wings strong enough to batter your foes away and shove them away. Choose up to two creatures adjacent to you. Attempt an Athletics check check and compare it to the Fortitude DC of each target. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to double your level (2 bludgeoning) and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

**Success** The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level (1 bludgeoning) and is pushed up to 5 feet away from you.

**Failure** The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level (0 bludgeoning).

**Critical Failure** You fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] at the end of this activity.
