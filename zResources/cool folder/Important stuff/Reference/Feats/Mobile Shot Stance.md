# Mobile Shot Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/stance]]

**Category** class; 




Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged Strikes don't trigger Reactive Strike or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.

* * *

**Special** If you have [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]], you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
