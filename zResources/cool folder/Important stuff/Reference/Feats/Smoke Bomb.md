# Smoke Bomb
## Feat 2
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/additive]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can add a tarry additive to an alchemical bomb to make it emit smoke. When thrown, in addition to its normal effects, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot burst. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the [[Concealed|Concealed]] condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
