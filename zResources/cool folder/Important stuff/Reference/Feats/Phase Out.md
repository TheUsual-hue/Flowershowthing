# Phase Out `pf2:3`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/evolution]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Summoner]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** your eidolon is a phantom
* * *
Your eidolon phases out of reality slightly, gaining resistance to all damage (except force and negative) equal to half your level. It's not incorporeal, but it can't use Strikes or actions that require a fully physical form, such as [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]].

Your eidolon can return to its normal form with a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
