# Multifaceted Will
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Seneschal Witch Dedication
* * *
Without the firm hand of a patron, your power begins to reflect deeper complexities, sometimes latching onto entirely unexpected sources of magical potency. When you cast or Sustain [[Manifest Will|Manifest Will]], you can choose any tradition's manifestation. While the spell is active, you and allies in its area gain a +1 status bonus to saves against spells with that tradition trait.
