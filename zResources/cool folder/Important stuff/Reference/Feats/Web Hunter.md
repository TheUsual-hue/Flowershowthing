# Web Hunter
## Feat 9

Through the careful cultivation of highly sensitive hairs, you've developed the ability to sense creatures without seeing them. You gain imprecise tremorsense at a range of 15 feet. When you and a creature are both touching the same anchored, threadlike object (such as a rope, webbing, or wire), your imprecise tremorsense can sense that creature at a range of 60 feet.
