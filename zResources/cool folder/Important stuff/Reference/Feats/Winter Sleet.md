# Winter Sleet `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/cold]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/impulse]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Kineticist]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/primal]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/stance]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/water]]

**Category** class; 




Bone-chilling, swirling sleet surrounds you, cruel as deepest winter. Surfaces in your kinetic aura are coated in slippery ice. A creature that moves on the ice immediately falls unless it succeeds at an Acrobatics check check or Reflex check save against your impulse DC â€“ 2. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt a check or save. You're immune to this effect.

If a creature on the ice is critically hit by one of your water impulses or critically fails at a save against one, that creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn.
