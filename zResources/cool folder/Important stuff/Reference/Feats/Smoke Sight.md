**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

You're used to fighting and hiding in a haze of smoke and flame. You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a [[Concealed|Concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke. When you are concealed or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] in smoke, increase the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're concealed or 12 if you're hidden.
