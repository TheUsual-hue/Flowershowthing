# Sinister Appearance
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/naari]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You possess horns, a tail, or red eyes, or could otherwise be mistaken for a tiefling. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Intimidation. If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus on Deception checks to [[Impersonate|Impersonate]] when pretending to be a version of yourself who is a tiefling.
