You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one [[Heal|Heal]] spell you've prepared in your extra slots from your healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: [[Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]], [[Clear Mind|Clear Mind]], [[Sound Body|Sound Body]], or [[Sure Footing|Sure Footing]].
