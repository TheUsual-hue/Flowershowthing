# Paired Link
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/esoterica]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/fortune]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/occult]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 




You break a trinket such as a lodestone or jade pendant in two, creating a sympathetic link between the halves that bridges distance. During your daily preparations, you perform a short ceremony where you gift one of the two halves to a willing ally. On that ally, you can cast spells and use thaumaturge abilities that have a range of touch at a range of 30 feet instead, and the ally can cast spells that have a range of touch on you from a range of 30 feet. These effects last as long as you and the ally have their half; if either half leaves either of your possession for even a moment, or if you establish a link with a new ally during your next daily preparations, the link breaks.
