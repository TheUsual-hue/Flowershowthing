# Nourishing Symbiosis
## Feat 5
### [[Yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




As you recuperate from your wounds, life energy flows from you to the land and back to you again. During downtime mode, when you take the [[Long-Term Rest|Long-Term Rest]] activity, you regain an additional 24 Hit Points after the first 24 hours of rest. You can use the [[Subsist|Subsist]] activity during a long-term rest and don't need to spend any additional time to do so. When you do so, fruits, nuts, and vegetables sufficient to feed 5 people flourish overnight around you, ripe for the picking.
