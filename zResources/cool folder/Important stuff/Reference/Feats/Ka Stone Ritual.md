# Ka Stone Ritual `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Living Monolith Dedication; a sphinx or living monolith with this feat performs a ritual with you
* * *
You inscribe your true name on your _ka stone_, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. The _ka stone_ is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can't be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.

The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against death effects and negative effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.
