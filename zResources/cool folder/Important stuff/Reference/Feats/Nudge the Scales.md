# Nudge the Scales `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/cursebound]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/divine]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/healing]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Oracle]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/spirit]]

**Category** class; 




You lay a finger on the scales of life and death to heal a creature, regardless of whether it's living or undead. You restore 4 healing Hit Points to one creature within 30 feet.

In addition, you can mediate during your daily preparations to place yourself on one side of the scales. Choose life or death. If you align yourself with life, you are healed by vitality healing effects, as normal for most living creatures; if you align yourself with death, you gain the void healing ability, causing you to be healed by void effects that restore Hit Points and any other effects that restore Hit Points to undead creatures.
