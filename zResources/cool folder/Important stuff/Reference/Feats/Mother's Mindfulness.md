# Mother's Mindfulness `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/changeling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** An adjacent ally is hit by an attack.

* * *

You have the protective instinct your own mother lacks and will gladly suffer in another's place. You interpose yourself in the attack's path. You become the target of the triggering attack and are automatically hit by the attack (or critically hit if the ally was critically hit), suffering the full effects in your ally's place.
