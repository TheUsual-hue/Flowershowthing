# Quicksoul
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/talos]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The elemental metal in your bloodline literally courses through your veins in the form of liquid metals like mercury, rubidium, gallium, and djezet, giving your actions a languid fluidity. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. As these metals are largely toxic to organic life, you also gain the Toxic Touch action.

**Toxic Touch** `pf2:1` (poison)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to [[Tumble Through|Tumble Through]], and you successfully moved through an enemy's space

* * *

**Effect** Make a melee unarmed Strike against the enemy whose space you moved through. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 persistent poison damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (or takes 2d6 persistent poison and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical hit).
