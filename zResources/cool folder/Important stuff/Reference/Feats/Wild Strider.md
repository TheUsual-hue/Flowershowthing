### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Horizon Walker Dedication

Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the ranger's [[Unimpeded Journey|Wild Stride]] class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from [[Favored Terrain|Favored Terrain]] based on the terrain.
