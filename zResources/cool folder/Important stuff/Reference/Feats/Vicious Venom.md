# Vicious Venom
## Feat 17
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/vishkanya]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Envenom
* * *
The venom you produce is exceptionally potent and difficult to overcome. Your vishkanyan venom gains the virulent trait, requiring two consecutive saves to reduce the venom's stage by 1. A critical success reduces your venom's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.
