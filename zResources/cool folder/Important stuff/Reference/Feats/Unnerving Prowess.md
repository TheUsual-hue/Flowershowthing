# Unnerving Prowess `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike or Disarm with your Aldori dueling sword.

* * *

Your incredible skill with your blade unnerves your foes. You attempt to [[Demoralize|Demoralize]] the target of your Strike or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Disarm|Disarm]]. This Demoralize attempt does not have the auditory trait, nor do you take a penalty to the check if the target doesn't understand your language.
