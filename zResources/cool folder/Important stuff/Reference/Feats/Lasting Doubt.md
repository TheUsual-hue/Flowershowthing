# Lasting Doubt
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** redeemer cause
* * *
When you cast doubt upon your foes, the effect lasts longer than usual.

After being enfeebled 2 by your [[Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption]], the foe is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.

If you have [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Feats/Weight of Guilt|Weight of Guilt]], after being stupefied 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is stupefied 1 for 1 minute or until the flat check from stupefied causes it to lose a spell, whichever comes first.
