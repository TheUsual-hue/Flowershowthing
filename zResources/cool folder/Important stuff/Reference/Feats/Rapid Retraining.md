## Feat 9

**Category** ancestry; 




Some feel trapped by their choices and have a tough time reinventing themselves. To you, this dilemma is just a natural part of reincarnation. [[Retraining|Retraining]] other feats or skill increases during downtime only takes 4 days instead of a week, and class features that require a choice can be retrained in a week instead of a month. You also never need to find a teacher to retrain, as the memories of abilities you possessed in past lives are superior to any instructor.
