# Stone Blood
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ka Stone Ritual

You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop persistent bleed damage you have from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the concentrate trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds. You recover naturally from the [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]] condition twice as quickly as normal.
