# Poison Coat `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Poisoner Dedication
* * *
In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines, and just brushing against them can prove deadly. You expend a contact or injury poison and spend 10 minutes brushing that poison onto your clothing or weaving sharp, poisoned needles into the garment's fabric. You can have only one poison suffused into your clothing at a time. You can use the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Once Bitten|Once Bitten]] reaction while you have a poison suffused in this way.
