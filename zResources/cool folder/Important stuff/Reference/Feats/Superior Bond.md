# Superior Bond
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Wizard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** arcane bond
* * *
When you draw upon your bonded item, you can leave a bit of energy within it for later use. You can use [[Drain Bonded Item|Drain Bonded Item]] one additional time per day, but only to cast a spell 2 or more ranks lower than your highest-rank wizard spell slot.
