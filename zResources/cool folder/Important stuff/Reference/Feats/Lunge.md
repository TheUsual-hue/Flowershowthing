# Lunge `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon.

* * *

You attack an enemy at the edge of your reach. Make a Strike with a melee weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for that Strike. If the weapon has the disarm, shove, or trip trait, you can use the corresponding action instead of a Strike.
