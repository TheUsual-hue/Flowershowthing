# Leap and Fire
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Hit the Dirt!
* * *
You're quick enough to line up a shot even while diving to the ground. When you use your Hit the Dirt! reaction, at any point during your Leap you can also make a ranged Strike with a loaded firearm or crossbow, targeting the creature whose attack triggered the reaction.
