# Oni's Mask
## Feat 5
### [[Hungerseed]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You aren't as malleable as your oni ancestors but still can disguise yourself. You can cast [[Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] as a 1st-rank primal innate spell once per day. This spell can't disguise your horns, though you can still hide them normally with a hairstyle or a hood.
