# Scintillating Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Light]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Sorcerer]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/spellshape]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Wizard]]

**Category** class; 




Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round.
