# Patron's Presence
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Witch]]

**Category** class; 




Your patron can direct its attention through your familiar, and its mere presence becomes an ominous weight on the minds of other beings to distract them and blot out their magic. Your familiar gains the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Patron's Presence|Patron's Presence]] activity.
