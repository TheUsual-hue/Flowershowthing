## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Barbarian]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]]

**Category** class; 




With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [[Strike|Strike]] against that enemy. You can use [[Sudden Charge|Sudden Charge]] while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
