# Insect Shape
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Untamed Form
* * *
Your understanding of life expands, allowing you to mimic a wider range of creatures. Add the shapes in [[Insect Form|Insect Form]] to your [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Untamed Form|Untamed Form]] list. Whenever you use _untamed form_ to polymorph into the non-flying insect shapes listed in pest form, the duration is 24 hours instead of 10 minutes.
