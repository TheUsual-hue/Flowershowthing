# Virga May
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/changeling]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Born of a storm hag, you have one crystal-blue or rain-gray eye. You share your mother's power over wind and storm. You can cast [[Electric Arc|Electric Arc]] as an occult innate cantrip. As normal, a cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
