# Second Thoughts `pf2:r`
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mental]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Wizard]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You cast a mental spell that targets one creature, and it critically succeeds at its Will save.

* * *

When your target proves resilient to your magical deceptions, you can try them again on someone else. You can Cast the triggering Spell a second time, targeting a different creature, without expanding an additional spell slot. You can do so only until the end of your next turn, and you can't use Second Thoughts on it after the second casting of the spell.
