# Sound Mirror
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Alter Ego Dedication
* * *
You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well, allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor noises as distractions-perfect for misdirection and infiltration. You can cast [[Silence|Silence]] on yourself as a 2nd-rank innate occult spell and [[Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]] as a 1st-rank innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast [[Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]] as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
