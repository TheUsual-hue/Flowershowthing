# Weapon Supremacy
## Feat 20
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 




Your skill with weapons bends the laws of reality, allowing you to continuously attack with speed that would normally require magical assistance. You're permanently [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]]. You can use your extra action only to Strike.
