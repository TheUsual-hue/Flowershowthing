**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Arcana

You are particularly adept at learning spells to add to your spellbook. You gain the [[Magical Shorthand|Magical Shorthand]] skill feat without needing to meet its prerequisites. Further, when you roll a critical failure on your check to Learn a Spell, you get a failure instead.
