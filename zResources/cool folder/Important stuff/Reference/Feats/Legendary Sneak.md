You're always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even when there's nowhere to hide. You can [[Hide|Hide]] and [[Sneak|Sneak]] even without cover or being [[Concealed|Concealed]]. When you employ an exploration tactic other than [[Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], you also gain the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to.
