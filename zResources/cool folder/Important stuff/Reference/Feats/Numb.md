# Numb
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Zombie Dedication
* * *
As your body continues to rot and putrefy, your senses deaden and your undead powers grow. You gain the [[Advanced Undead Benefits|Advanced Undead Benefits]] as well as a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against emotion and pain effects. While your body is [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Deteriorated|Deteriorated]], your numbness amplifies in two ways: the circumstance bonus from this feat increases to +2, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion or pain effect, you get a critical success instead.
