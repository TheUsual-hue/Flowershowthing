# Reveal Machinations `pf2:1`
## Feat 15
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/general]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Deception
* * *
You reveal that you played a minor but recurring role in another humanoid's life-or at least convince them that's the case. Attempt a Deception check check against the target's Will DC. On a success, the revelation makes them frightened 2, and on a critical success they are frightened 3. In addition, you gain information about the subject as though you had attempted to Recall Knowledge about them using an appropriate skill and received the same result on your roll. You can't use this ability against the same humanoid again until 1 day has passed and you've also successfully disguised yourself as a different person.
