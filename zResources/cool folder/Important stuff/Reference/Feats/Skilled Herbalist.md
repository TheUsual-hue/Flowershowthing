# Skilled Herbalist
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've been taught how to craft healing remedies with a variety of herbs and plants. You gain the [[Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat, except you must select the following items to add to your formula book: [[Equipment/Antidote (Lesser)|Antidote (Lesser)]], [[Antiplague (Lesser)|Antiplague (Lesser)]], and [[Equipment/Elixir of Life (Minor)|Elixir of Life (Minor)]], as well as a fourth 1st-level common alchemical formula of your choice. You can use Nature to Craft an alchemical item that has the healing trait, rather than Crafting.
