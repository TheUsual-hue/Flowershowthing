# Manifold Edge
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Ranger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** hunter's edge; masterful hunter
* * *
You've learned to leverage every possible edge. When you use [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]], you can gain a different hunter's edge benefit instead of the one you selected at 1st level. If you do, you don't gain the additional benefit from [[Masterful Hunter|Masterful Hunter]].
