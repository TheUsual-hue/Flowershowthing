You leverage your body's amorphous nature to spook others. Attempt to [[/act demoralize options=sudden-terror]] a creature within 30 feet. Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language. If you were [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to the creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you succeed, the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] instead of [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. All creatures that witnessed you use Sudden Terror are then temporarily immune to your Sudden Terror for 24 hours.
