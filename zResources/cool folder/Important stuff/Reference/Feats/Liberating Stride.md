# Liberating Stride
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** liberator cause
* * *
Instead of you taking a Step at the end of your [[Liberating Step|Liberating Step]], the triggering ally can Stride up to half their Speed.

Even if you have [[Exalted Reaction|Exalt]], only the triggering ally gains this benefit.
