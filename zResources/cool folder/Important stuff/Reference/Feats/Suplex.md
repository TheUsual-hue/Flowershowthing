# Suplex `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wrestler Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You have a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

Flexing your entire body, you heave your opponent over your head and slam them into the ground. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained; on a success, the target lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and on a critical success, the target lands prone and takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Regardless of whether the Strike is successful, you immediately release your hold on the target.
