# Shattering Shot `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or loaded crossbow and are wearing or holding an alchemical bomb.

* * *

You fling a bomb into the air and then shoot it with your gun before it falls, raining destruction down over a wide area. If necessary, you Interact to draw the bomb and regrip your weapon. You throw your bomb to the corner of a square within your firearm's first range increment and shoot it with your firearm. All creatures in a 15-foot burst of the bomb take the bomb's normal damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. They don't take any splash or persistent damage the bomb would deal normally.
