# Tumbling Lumber `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/impulse]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Kineticist]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/primal]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/wood]]

**Category** class; 




A slew of logs eject from the Plane of Wood and slam into your enemies. They roll in a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line. Non-magical difficult terrain on any ground the logs roll over is smashed flat; greater difficult terrain remains. Each creature in the area takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and might be moved by the logs, depending on its Reflex check save against your class DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed out of the line in the most direct path available.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

**Level (+3)** The damage increases by 1d8.
