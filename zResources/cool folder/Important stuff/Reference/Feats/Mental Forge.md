**Prerequisites** Mind Smith Dedication
* * *
Your experiences in combat shape your mind's capability to strengthen and shape your weapon to match the way you move in combat. Choose two of the following weapon traits to give your mind weapon: grapple, modular (B, P, S), nonlethal, shove, or trip. Once chosen, these weapon traits can't be changed unless you spend 1 week retraining your fighting style to swap one property for another from the list.
