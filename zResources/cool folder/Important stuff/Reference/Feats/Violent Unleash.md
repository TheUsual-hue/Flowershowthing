# Violent Unleash `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mindshift]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/occult]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Psychic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You Unleash your Psyche.

* * *

The force of your mind unleashing itself wracks your enemies with a violent shockwave. You deal 1d6 force damage to all creatures in a 20-foot emanation, with a basic Reflex save. This explosion is taxing, making you [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
