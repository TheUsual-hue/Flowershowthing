## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Five-Breath Vanguard Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're in an elemental stance.

* * *

Your blows can disrupt the delicate balance of elemental energies that keep a body in good health. Strike the target using the unarmed attack associated with your current elemental stance. On a success, the target must attempt a Fortitude check save against your class DC. On a failure, the target is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] until the end of your next turn. On a critical failure, the target is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 3]] for 1 minute. Elementals take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their save.
