# Morrigna's Spider Affinity
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Much like morrignas, you feel an affinity for spiders. You can cast [[Animal Messenger|Animal Messenger]], [[Speak with Animals|Speak with Animals]], and [[Gecko Grip|Gecko Grip]] each once per day as 2nd-rank divine innate spells.
