**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Prophesied Monarch Dedication
* * *
You command that your foes bow down before you or face your wrath. All enemies within 40 feet who can see and hear you must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to Kneel Before the Rightful Heir for 24 hours.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 3d6 persistent mental damage.

**Failure** The creature takes 6d6 persistent mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes 6d6 persistent mental damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as it's taking that persistent damage.

The persistent mental damage can be ended only if the creature Drops Prone in a location that you can see and doesn't Stand until their next turn. An affected creature is aware of this restriction.
