**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You roll a critical success on a Will save against a mental effect from a creature.

* * *

Your thoughts sting back when a lesser mind tries to invade your own. You deal mental damage equal to your level to the triggering creature. If you so desire, you can also send the creature a single mental image to coincide with the damage, such as a watchful eye or the dread of floating in an infinite sea.
