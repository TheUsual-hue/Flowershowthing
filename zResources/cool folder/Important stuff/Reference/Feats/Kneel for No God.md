# Kneel for No God
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** ancient-blooded dwarf heritage
* * *
**Access** Vahird ethnicity

* * *

Your ancestors' defiance of magic and your people's strictly egalitarian mindset mean that certain forms of magic have little effect on you. When you use your [[Call on Ancient Blood|Call on Ancient Blood]] reaction against a divine spell and roll a critical failure on the saving throw against that spell, you get a failure instead.
