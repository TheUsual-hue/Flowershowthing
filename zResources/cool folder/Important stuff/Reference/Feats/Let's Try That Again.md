# Let's Try That Again `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/fortune]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a skill check.

* * *

You feel a sense of deja vu when you've made a mistake, almost as if you weren't so careless in a past life and could certainly do better if given another chance. Reroll the triggering skill check and use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.
