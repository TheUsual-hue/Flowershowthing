# Whispering Steps
## Feat 8
### [[amp]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mental]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/occult]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Psychic]]

**Category** class; 




Your spell leaves a lingering connection between you and a creature-one through which you can nudge the creature's mind this way or that. The amped cantrip must take 2 or more actions to cast, target one or more creatures, and either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry.

* * *

**Amp** Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the creature's mind, forcing it to [[Step|Step]] in a direction of your choosing; as this is forced movement, you can't force the creature to Step into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or the like. After it Steps, the creature becomes temporarily immune to this amp for 24 hours.
