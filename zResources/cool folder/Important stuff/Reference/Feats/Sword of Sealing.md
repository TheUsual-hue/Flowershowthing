# Sword of Sealing
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spirit Warrior Dedication
* * *
Your spiritual power pierces both body and soul, pinning your foe in place. Make a melee Strike with a one-handed, agile, or finesse weapon, or your fist unarmed attack. On a successful hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude check save against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC, or become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. The target can end this immobilization with a successful [[Escape|Escape]] attempt using the higher of your class DC or your spell DC as the Escape DC.
