**Category** class; 




Dark thunderclouds swirl in a miniature storm, crisscrossed with lightning bolts; a tremendous thunderclap fills the air. The storm appears in a 20-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes 0d12 electricity + 1d10 sonic damage, with a Reflex check save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] until the end of its next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical failure). A creature wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a -1 circumstance penalty to its save.

**Level (+3)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.
