# Nonlethal Takedown
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lastwall Sentry Dedication
* * *
You prefer to use nonlethal means against living opponents, but the weapons you carry are lethal enough to destroy undead. You don't take the normal -2 circumstance penalty when attacking nonlethally with a weapon that lacks the nonlethal trait.
