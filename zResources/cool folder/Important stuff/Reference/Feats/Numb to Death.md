# Numb to Death
## Feat 7
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/general]]

**Category** general; 



**Prerequisites** Diehard; You have died at least once
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your past has left you numb to death's call. The first time each day that you regain Hit Points while you are dying, you gain a circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points you regain equal to your level, and you neither gain the wounded condition nor increase the value of this condition.
