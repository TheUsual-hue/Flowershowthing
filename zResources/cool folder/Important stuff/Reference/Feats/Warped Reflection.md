Due to your origins, your form is more flexible than most. You shift your appearance to resemble a creature within 30 feet but with an unsettling, horrifying twist. Though this transformation is momentary, witnessing it gives the target deep existential dread. It must succeed at a Will check save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure) and be [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] as long as the frightened condition lasts. Once you've used Warped Reflection against a creature, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.
