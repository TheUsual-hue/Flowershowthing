# Martial Performance
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Bard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** warrior muse
* * *
Your muse has taught you how to handle a wider variety of weapons than most bards, empowering you to effortlessly blend your performance into combat tools. When you have a [[Courageous Anthem|Courageous Anthem]] composition cantrip active, and you damage an enemy with a Strike, the spell's duration is extended by 1 round. You can extend an individual casting only once in this way.

If you gain the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]] or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Song of Strength|Song of Strength]] composition cantrips, you can apply this benefit to those cantrips as well.
