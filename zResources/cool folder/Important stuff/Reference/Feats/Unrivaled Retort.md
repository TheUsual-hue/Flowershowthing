## Feat 6
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You are about to attempt a Fortitude or Reflex save against an area effect and are wielding a ranged weapon.

* * *

You defy the death and destruction around you while using it to fuel your mythic power, spurring you on to acts of incredible speed and empowering a mighty ranged counterattack. Spend a Mythic Point and attempt the triggering save at mythic proficiency. If the save is successful, you can immediately reload and make a ranged Strike targeting the originator of the triggering effect.
