# Underworld Investigator
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Investigator]]

**Category** class; 




Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you might have gained an understanding of how they operate from the outside. You become trained in Underworld Lore, and you gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus to Thievery checks to investigate a case (such as checks to [[Steal|Steal]] a clue from a suspect or Pick a Lock to open a safe with damning documents).
