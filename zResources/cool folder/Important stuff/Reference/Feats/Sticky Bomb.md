# Sticky Bomb
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/additive]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can mix in a sticky additive to an alchemical bomb to make its contents adhere and continue to deal damage. A creature hit by a sticky bomb also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts.
