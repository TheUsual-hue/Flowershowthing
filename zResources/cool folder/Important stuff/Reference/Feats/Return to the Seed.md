# Return to the Seed
## Feat 17
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Once per month, when you die, you can instead choose to fade away. Your corpse is swallowed by the earth, leaving behind only a seed. This seed is very fragile with an AC of 10 and only 1 Hit Point. Another creature can spend 1 minute to plant the seed in a safe space and water it. If so cared for, the next morning a tree grows from it with a single large fruit or flower bud that splits open to reveal you, alive and returned to maximum Hit Points.
