# Trample (Sarangay) `pf2:3`
## Feat 17
### [[Sarangay]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You know how to leverage your size and momentum when using your horns attack, and can use your movement speed to overrun your foes. You Stride up to double your Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures at least one size smaller than you, Trampling each creature whose space you enter. You can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single Trample. You deal piercing damage equal to the damage of your horns unarmed attack against these creatures, which can attempt a Reflex check save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
