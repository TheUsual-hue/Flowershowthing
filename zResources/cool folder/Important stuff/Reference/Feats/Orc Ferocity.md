# Orc Ferocity `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed.

* * *

Fierceness in battle runs through your blood, and you refuse to fall from your injuries no matter how terrible they may be. You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, and your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition increases by 1.
