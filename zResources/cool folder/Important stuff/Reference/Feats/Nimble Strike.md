# Nimble Strike
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You're cunning enough to find an opening in an opponent's attack. When you use your [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Feats/Nimble Dodge|Nimble Dodge]] reaction, you can make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. If you use the [[Nimble Roll|Nimble Roll]] feat, you can make this Strike at any point during your roll.
