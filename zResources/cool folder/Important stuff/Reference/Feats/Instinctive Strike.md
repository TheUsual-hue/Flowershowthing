**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Acute Scent or scent
* * *
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all your senses to pinpoint your opponent's location. When you make a melee Strike against an opponent you're detecting using scent, ignore any flat check required due to the target being [[Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]].
