## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/shoony]]

**Category** ancestry;

You can use the [[Aid|Aid]] reaction to grant a bonus to another creature's Will saving throw. As usual for Aid, you need to prepare by using an action on your turn to encourage the creature to bravely withstand the effect.
