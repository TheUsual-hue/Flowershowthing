Axis's order suffuses your body and helps it maintain coherency. You and your allies can Treat your Wounds without healer's tools. Once per day, when someone rolls a failure or a critical failure on a check to Treat your Wounds, you can focus on your internal cohesion to increase the degree of success by one step.
