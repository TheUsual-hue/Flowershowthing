# One-Toed Hop `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/tengu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Assuming a peculiar stance, you make a short hop on each toe. You make a vertical [[Leap|Leap]] without triggering reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.
