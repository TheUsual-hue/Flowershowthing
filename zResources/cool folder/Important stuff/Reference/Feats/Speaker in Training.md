# Speaker in Training
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** budding speaker centaur heritage or the ability to cast a divine or primal spell
* * *
You've begun your training as a Speaker. Select divine or primal. If you selected divine, you're a Faithspeaker. If you selected primal, you're a Greenspeaker. If you've already made this decision (such as due to being a budding speaker) you must select the same Speaker you previously chose. This choice can't be changed. If you're a Faithspeaker, you can cast [[Bless|Bless]] once per day as a divine innate spell; if you're a Greenspeaker, you can cast [[Fleet Step|Fleet Step]] once per day as a primal innate spell.
