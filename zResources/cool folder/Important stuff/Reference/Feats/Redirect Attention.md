# Redirect Attention
## Feat 13
### [[zTemplates/New folder/Bestiary/zz_traits/reflection]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Through your strong connection with your progenitor, you're able to redirect those attempting to spy on you. Whenever you would be directly targeted with a scrying effect, the effect must attempt a counteract check against the higher of your spell DC or class DC. If the check fails, the effect targets your progenitor instead of you.
