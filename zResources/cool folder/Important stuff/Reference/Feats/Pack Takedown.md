# Pack Takedown
## Feat 20
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lead the Pack
* * *
**Requirements** You have two active companions.

* * *

The pack is strongest when it acts as one, and like a group of hungry wolves, you work together to bring down a single target. If you and both of your active companions threaten the same creature, each of you makes a melee Strike against it. The creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against all of these attacks. If more than one attack hits, combine the damage from all successful Strikes, and apply resistances and weaknesses only once.
