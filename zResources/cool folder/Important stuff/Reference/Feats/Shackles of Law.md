# Shackles of Law `pf2:2`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]]

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Chain
* * *
You attempt to subdue a target with an attack and a follow-up grab. Make a melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature you hit. If you're wielding a flail, you can ignore Grapple's requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.
