# Nagaji Spell Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Either through study, exposure, or familial devotion, you have the magic of nagas bubbling in your blood. During your daily preparations, choose [[Daze|Daze]], [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]], or [[Telekinetic Hand|Telekinetic Hand]]. Until your next daily preparations, you can cast the chosen spell as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
