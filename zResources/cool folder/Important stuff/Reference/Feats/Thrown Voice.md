# Thrown Voice
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/strix]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned how to throw your voice through the winds, tricking others as to your location. You can cast [[Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]] as a primal innate spell once per day. If you're a songbird strix, you can cast it twice per day instead.
