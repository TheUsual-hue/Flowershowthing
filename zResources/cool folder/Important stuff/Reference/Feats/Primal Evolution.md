**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** bloodline that grants primal spells

You can call upon the creatures of the wild for aid. You gain an additional spell slot of your highest rank, which you can use only to cast [[Summon Animal|Summon Animal]] or [[Summon Plant or Fungus|Summon Plant or Fungus]]. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if it they aren't in your spell repertoire.
