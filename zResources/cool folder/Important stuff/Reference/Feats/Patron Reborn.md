# Patron Reborn
## Feat 20
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Seneschal Witch Dedication
* * *
You have fully realized the ability to serve as a patron.

Your newfound abilities enhance your senses, rolling back the veil of a realm hidden to most mortals where great beings vie for unimaginable influence over vast worlds. You gain darkvision, constant [[Truesight|Truesight]], and the ability to see into all other transitive planes that overlap the one you are in.

You can be a patron for other witches. Choose a single type of patron you represent, such as The Resentment or Starless Shadow. An allied witch you can observe who has that patron counts as and gains the benefits of your Witch's Charge feat, even if you did not select them as your charge during your daily preparations.

You learn the [[Wish|Wish]] ritual and can impart that knowledge to your charges. Once per month, when one of your charges performs the _wish_ ritual, you can roll the skill check in their place.
