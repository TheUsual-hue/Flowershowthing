### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/impulse]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Kineticist]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/metal]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/overflow]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/primal]]

**Category** class; 




Razor-sharp slivers of metal fall from the sky. Each creature in a 20-foot burst within 60 feet takes 3d6 slashing damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC. The razors embed in all surfaces in the area, making them hazardous terrain for 1 minute. A creature that moves through this hazardous terrain takes 3 slashing damage for every square of the area it moves into.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The initial damage increases by 1d6 and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.
