**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dueling Parry; Duelist Dedication
* * *
You protect those near to you with a flash of steel and a stroke of good luck. When you're benefiting from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have [[Dueling Riposte|Dueling Riposte]], you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself.
