# Practiced Brawn
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You're accustomed to long days filled with hard physical labor. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Force Open|Force Open]] and [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]], and to Fortitude saving throws to resist becoming [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]]. When you roll a success on an Athletics check to Shove, you get a critical success instead.
