**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Drow Shootist Dedication
* * *
You become trained in the [[Equipment/Repeating Hand Crossbow|Repeating Hand Crossbow]] and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and [[Equipment/Shootist Bandolier|Shootist Bandolier]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a repeating hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the [[Shootist's Draw|Shootist's Draw]] action with repeating hand crossbows.

**Special** If you have the [[Running Reload|Running Reload]] feat, you can reload a [[Equipment/Repeating Hand Crossbow Magazine|Repeating Hand Crossbow Magazine]] on the move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you Stride, Step, or Sneak, or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.
