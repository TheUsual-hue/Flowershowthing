# Uncanny Cheeks
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You gain the [[Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] and [[Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] feats, except that you always withdraw the objects from your cheek pouches. This means the object you retrieve must fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of negligible Bulk unless you also have the [[Cheek Pouches|Cheek Pouches]] feat.
