**Category** class;

Mythic power floods through your mind, filling you with visions of possible futures, events that might or might not happen, and warnings of things that might be. Spend a Mythic Point and roll your initiative check using mythic proficiency. Until the end of your first turn, you have a +1 status bonus to AC and all saves.
