When you cast [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Light|Light]], you can modify its target to be 1 melee weapon, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally, and modify its duration to be 1 minute. If you do, add the following to its effects: When a creature wielding the weapon critically hits a foe, you can [[Dismiss|Dismiss]] the Spell as a reaction, causing the foe to be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.
