Water is the source of life, and you draw upon this primordial force to heal your allies' wounds. A gentle ring ripples out from you in a 15-foot emanation, restoring 0d6 healing vitality Hit Points to creatures in the area. At 12th level and every two levels thereafter, the amount restored increases by 1d6. If you are [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound 3]] when you use Waters of Creation, the amount healed increases to 0d8 healing vitality.
