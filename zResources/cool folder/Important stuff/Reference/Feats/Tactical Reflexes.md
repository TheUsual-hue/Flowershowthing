# Tactical Reflexes
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 




You are particularly swift at punishing foes who leave you openings. At the start of each of your turns when you regain your actions, you gain an additional reaction that can be used only to make a [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]].
