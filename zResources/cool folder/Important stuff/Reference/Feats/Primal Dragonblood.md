# Primal Dragonblood
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dragonblood]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




A dragon with a deep connection to the natural world, such as an adamantine dragon or a horned dragon, resides somewhere on your family tree. You tend to trust your instincts and might take on the role of a protector of the wilderness. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Nature. If you would automatically become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use Nature to Sense Direction and Subsist in the wilds. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose a primal dragon.
