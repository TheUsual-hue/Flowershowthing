**Category** class; 




You smash a metal rod into your foe and call lightning to it. Attempt a 2-action melee or ranged Elemental Blast using the metal element. On a hit, the target takes an additional 0d12 electricity damage and is skewered with a metal rod, which gives it a –1 circumstance penalty to AC and saves against electricity; the penalty is –2 if the creature also has the metal trait, is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor. The creature can attempt to pull the rod free using an Interact action, but must succeed at a DC 10 Athletics check check.

**Level (+6)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.
