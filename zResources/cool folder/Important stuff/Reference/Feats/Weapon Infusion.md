# Weapon Infusion `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/infusion]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Kineticist]]

**Category** class; 




With a signature flair, you shape blasts of elemental power into the form of a weapon, such as a sword made of whirling wind or a bow that shoots flames. If your next action is an Elemental Blast, choose a weapon shape for it to take. You can choose to change the blast's damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing-whichever suits the weapon shape-and you can choose other alterations depending on whether you make a melee or ranged blast.

*   **Melee** Add one of the following traits of your choice: agile, backswing, forceful, reach, sweep.
*   **Ranged** Choose one of three options: range increment 100 feet and the volley 30 feet trait, range increment 50 feet and the propulsive trait, or range increment 20 feet and the thrown trait.
