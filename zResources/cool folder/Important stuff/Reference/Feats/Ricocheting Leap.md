# Ricocheting Leap
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Wall Jump
* * *
You quickly use your momentum to topple and spring off of foes. You can use [[Wall Jump|Wall Jump]] to make additional jumps off of creatures larger than you as if they were walls. Once per turn when you make an additional jump off of a creature in this way, you can also attempt to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]] or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]] that creature as a free action.
