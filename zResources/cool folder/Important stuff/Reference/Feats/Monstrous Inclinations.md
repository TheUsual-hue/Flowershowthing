**Category** class; 




**Requirements** Your attuned apparition grants Forest Lore or Ocean Lore as one of its apparition skills.

* * *

Your apparitions share with you the monstrous nature of those creatures who dwell in deep seas or ancient woods. You add [[Monstrosity Form|Monstrosity Form]] to your apparition spell repertoire, allowing you to cast it with your apparition spellcasting.

* * *

**Special** If you are attuned to a stalker in darkened boughs, add the phoenix form from _monstrosity form_ to your available [[Darkened Forest Form|Darkened Forest Form]] options when you cast the spell heightened to 8th rank.

If you are attuned to a lurker in devouring dark, add the cave worm and sea serpent forms to your [[Devouring Dark Form|Devouring Dark Form]] options as a polymorph effect when you cast the spell heightened to 8th rank.
