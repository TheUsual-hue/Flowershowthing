# Storyteller's Mask
## Feat 20
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Druid]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Wizard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask remembers the stories of Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future. You can cast [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Foresight|Foresight]] once per day as an innate spell, either arcane if you have Wizard Dedication or primal if you have Druid Dedication, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only a single foe, you can [[Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about that foe.
