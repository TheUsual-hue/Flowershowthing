**Category** class; 




A healing wave splashes across creatures in a 30-foot cone, its cleansing water driving afflictions from the body. Each creature in the area regains 3d8 healing HP and can attempt a new save against one poison or disease affliction affecting it; on a failed save, the condition doesn't worsen.

Each creature that benefited from this impulse becomes temporarily immune to Torrent in the Blood for 10 minutes.

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d8.
