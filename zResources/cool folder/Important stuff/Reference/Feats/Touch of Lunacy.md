**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication
* * *
In moments of viciousness, your curse can partially infect your prey. Whenever you critically succeed with an unarmed attack from the werecreature archetype, the target must attempt a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC, or become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] until the beginning of your next turn as their bones elongate and form warps. On a critical failure, the target is also [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for one minute as the transformation lingers.
