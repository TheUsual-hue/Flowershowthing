# Unyielding Disguise
## Feat 9
### [[zTemplates/New folder/Bestiary/zz_traits/reflection]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** ability to cast humanoid form or illusory disguise
* * *
When you cast [[Humanoid Form|Humanoid Form]] or [[Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] to alter your appearance, the spell's duration is 2 hours. At the end of the duration, you can extend the spell's duration for another hour, but doing so is taxing, making you [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]. You can keep extending it in this way, increasing your drained condition by 1 each time, to a maximum duration of 6 hours.
