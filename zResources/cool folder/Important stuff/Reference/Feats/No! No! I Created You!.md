### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/auditory]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Feats/Inventor]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** construct companion
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** Your construct companion would become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] or controlled.

You appeal to your construct companion's bond with its creator to have it break free of a controlling effect. Attempt to counteract the effect that confused or controlled your construct companion, using your Crafting modifier for the counteract check and half your level rounded up for the counteract rank.
