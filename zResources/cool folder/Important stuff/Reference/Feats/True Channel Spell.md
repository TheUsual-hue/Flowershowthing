# True Channel Spell
## Feat 20
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Animist]]

**Category** class; 




You are a true conduit for spiritual power, able to unleash the greatest spells. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using animist spellcasting. You can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.
