# Sly Disarm
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You can [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] a creature through sleight of hand rather than brute force. You can use Thievery instead of Athletics when you attempt a Disarm. When you use Thievery to attempt a Disarm and succeed, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
