# Lie Detector
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** empiricism or interrogation methodology
* * *
You're adept at noticing the tells of a liarâ€”sweat, flushing, a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] and to Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you. When you determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check you attempt against that creature within the next minute.

If you would gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus to any of the above checks, that bonus increases by 1 instead of you gaining the +1 bonus listed.
