# Suspect of Opportunity `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Person of Interest
* * *
**Trigger** A creature who isn't, to your knowledge, tied to any of your active investigations takes a hostile action against you in combat.

* * *

Sometimes something intrudes upon your case unexpectedly, such as an ambush sent to bring your investigation to a close. You use Person of Interest against the triggering creature. This doesn't allow you to use Person of Interest more frequently than normal.
