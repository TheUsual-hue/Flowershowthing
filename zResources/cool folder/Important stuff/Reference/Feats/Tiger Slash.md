# Tiger Slash `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Tiger Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Tiger Stance|Tiger Stance]]

* * *

You make a fierce swipe with both hands. Make a tiger claw Strike. It deals two extra weapon damage dice (three extra dice if you're 14th level or higher), and you can push the target 5 feet away as if you had successfully [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shoved]] them.

If the attack is a critical success and deals damage, add your Strength modifier to the persistent bleed damage from your tiger claw.
