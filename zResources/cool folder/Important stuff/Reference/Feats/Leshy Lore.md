You deeply understand your people's cultural traditions and innate strengths. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Nature and Stealth. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Leshy Lore.
