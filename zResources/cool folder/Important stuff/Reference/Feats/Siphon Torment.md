# Siphon Torment
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your progenitors suffered greatly at the hands of a curse, a fate you willingly take upon yourself rather than let fall upon others. Once per day, you can cast [[Claim Curse|Claim Curse]] as an innate divine spell. When you do, the target creature gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level.
