# Natural Illusionist
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/gnome]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Illusion Sense
* * *
By drawing upon the First World's magic, you can siphon a portion of that malleable world to create a convincing illusion. Once per day, you can cast [[Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], [[Item Facade|Item Facade]], or [[Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]]. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd rank, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell rank.
