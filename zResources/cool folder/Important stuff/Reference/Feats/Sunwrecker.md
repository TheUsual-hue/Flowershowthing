# Sunwrecker
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Exemplar]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/ikon]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued into any weapon ikon

* * *

Your weapon has the might of legends, capable of shooting or striking any light out of the sky. The imbued ikon gains the following abilities.

**Immanence** (darkness) on a successful critical hit with the weapon, the weapon casts 2nd-rank darkness centered on the target of the attack.

**Transcendenceâ€”Break the Sun's Legs** `pf2:2` (cold, concentrate, darkness, transcendence) You make a slashing motion over the brightest source of light, whether it's a torch or the sun in the sky. A gash appears over the light source, visible to all, and devours the light. The entire area within a 120-foot burst around you is affected by a 9th-rank darkness spell for 1 minute. The stolen light is channeled to your eyes, granting you greater darkvision for the duration of the effect.
