# Iron Belly
## Feat 1
### [[Tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




A good laugh comes from the belly, and by laughing every day, yours has grown quite strong. You have a belly melee unarmed Strike, which deals 1d6 damage, is in the brawling group, and has the forceful trait.

**Special** It's never too late to learn to laugh, so you can select this feat at any level and retrain into and out of this feat.
