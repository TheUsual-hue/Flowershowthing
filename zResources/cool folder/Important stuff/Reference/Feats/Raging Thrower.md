# Raging Thrower
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




Thrown weapons become especially deadly in your fury. You apply the additional damage from [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Rage|Rage]] to your thrown weapon attacks. If you have the [[Brutal Critical|Brutal Critical]] feat or the [[Devastator|Devastator]] class feature, apply their benefits to thrown weapon attacks.
