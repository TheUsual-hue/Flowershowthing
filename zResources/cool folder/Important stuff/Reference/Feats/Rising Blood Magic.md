The power within your blood grows. You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Basic Spellcasting Feat|Basic Spellcasting Feat]] benefits. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new rank from the bloodrager archetype, add a common spell of the appropriate tradition and rank to your repertoire. In addition, when you Cast a Spell from your repertoire and you are at least [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], increase the extra damage dealt by that spell from Rage by 1.
