# Predatory Claws
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vampire Dedication

Your nails grow into sharp claws, perfect for seizing and tearing your prey. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.

If you hit the same enemy with two consecutive claw Strikes in the same round, you can attempt to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] that same target as a free action, provided you take that action immediately after the second Strike.
