# Soaring Dynamo
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sterling Dynamo Dedication
* * *
You've built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo, allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour, measured from the first time you use the Fly action in a given minute.
