You attune your great skill in performing to another, granting them a small measure of your skill as though anyone could do it. If your next action is casting a composition spell with an emanation area, its area spreads from a willing ally of your choice within 60 feet instead of you.

If you have [[Directed Audience|Directed Audience]], you can have that cone originate from the ally instead.
