## Feat 1
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The experience you've accumulated over multiple lifetimes envelops you like a weighted blanket, providing comfort and bestowing confidence under pressure. You gain the trained proficiency rank in one skill of your choice and the [[Assurance|Assurance]] skill feat in that skill as a bonus feat.
