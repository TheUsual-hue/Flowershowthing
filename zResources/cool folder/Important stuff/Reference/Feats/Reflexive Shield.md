# Reflexive Shield
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 




You can use your shield to fend off explosions and the like. When you [[Raise a Shield|Raise your Shield]], you gain your shield's circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.

* * *

**Special** If you have the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction, damage you take as a result of a Reflex save can trigger that reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
