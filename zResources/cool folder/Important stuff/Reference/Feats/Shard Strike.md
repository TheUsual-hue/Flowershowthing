# Shard Strike `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/impulse]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Kineticist]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/metal]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/primal]]

**Category** class; 




Jagged metal shards form in the air and lash out from you. You choose shards or spines, which changes the area, damage type, and critical failure effect. Each creature in the area attempts a Reflex check save against your class DC. Shards deal 1d6 slashing damage in a 15-foot cone, and a creature that critically fails takes 1d6 bleed damage. Spines deal 1d6 piercing damage in a 30-foot line, and a creature that critically fails is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the start of your next turn.

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
