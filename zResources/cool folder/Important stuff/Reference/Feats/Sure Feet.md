# Sure Feet
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Whether keeping your balance or climbing, your feet easily find purchase. If you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to [[Balance|Balance]] or an Athletics check to[[Climb|Climb]], you get a critical success instead. You're not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] when you attempt to Balance or Climb.
