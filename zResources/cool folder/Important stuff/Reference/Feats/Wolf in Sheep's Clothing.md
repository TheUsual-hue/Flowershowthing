# Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Ranger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Trained in Deception
* * *
With a bit of hide, some antlers, and some cast-off fur, you can create a disguise that will fool even an experienced hunter. You can [[Impersonate|Impersonate]] creatures with the animal, beast, or plant traits, so long as they are either the same size or one size larger than you and have a body shape that conforms at least vaguely to your own (in other words, a typical humanoid could Impersonate a bear or an arboreal, but not a horse, giant scorpion, or assassin vine). Impersonating a larger creature doesn't change your actual size.
