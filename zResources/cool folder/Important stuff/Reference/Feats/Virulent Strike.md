* * *
Those afflicted by certain maladies are closer to death in your presence. Make a Strike against a creature. If your attack hits, the target must attempt a new saving throw against the highest-level disease or poison that is currently affecting it, possibly progressing it to a higher stage even if the affliction's interval hasn't passed. If the target successfully saves or critically saves against the affliction, the affliction's stage isn't reduced. If your attack was a critical hit, the target takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to the save.
