# Shared Replenishment
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Replenishment of War
* * *
When your deity blesses your warlike acts, you can extend that favor to your allies. You can grant the temporary Hit Points from [[Replenishment of War|Replenishment of War]] to an ally within 10 feet instead of gaining them yourself. You can grant these temporary Hit Points to a different ally each time, meaning you might be able to grant them to multiple creatures in a single turn.
