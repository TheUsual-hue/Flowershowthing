## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Halcyon Speaker Dedication

You can cast [[Creation|Creation]] as an innate spell at will, choosing whether it is arcane or primal each time. The created object lasts until you spend 1 hour not within its immediate vicinity or until it is destroyed. Such objects are called persistent creations. If you cast _creation_ again, any persistent creation you previously created with the spell immediately disintegrates.
