You're trained in Crafting. If you are trained in Crafting from another source (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can [[Repair|Repair]] an item without using a repair toolkit without taking the â€“2 circumstance penalty, improvising tools from whatever you have at hand. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Repair an item when you have a repair toolkit.
