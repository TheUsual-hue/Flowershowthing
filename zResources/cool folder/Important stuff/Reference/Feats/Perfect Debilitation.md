# Perfect Debilitation
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You have perfected the formulas for bombs that impede your enemies. When you use [[Debilitating Bomb|Debilitating Bomb]], your target avoids the condition the bomb imposes only if it critically succeeds at its saving throw.
