# Moray Eel Mount
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have either trained a giant moray eel since its hatching or have tamed one in the wild. You gain the [[Bonded Animal|Bonded Animal]] skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites, to bond with a giant moray eel. When you [[Command an Animal|Command this Animal]] while you are mounted on it to take a move action, you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check.

* * *

**Special** If you have the Elver Pet or Growing Eel Friend ancestry feats, you can choose to have that pet become your bonded animal. You don't need to spend 7 days of downtime to bond with the eel, and you automatically succeed at the Nature check. You can then retrain those feats.
