# Monster Hunter
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Ranger]]

**Category** class; 




You quickly assess your prey and apply what you know. As part of the action used to Hunt your Prey, you can attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about your prey. When you critically succeed at identifying your hunted prey with [[Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], you note a weakness in the creature's defenses in addition to any other benefits. You and allies you tell gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that prey. You can give bonuses from Monster Hunter only once per day against a particular creature.
