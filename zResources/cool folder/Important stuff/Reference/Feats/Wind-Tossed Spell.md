**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Elementalist Dedication; air is in your elemental philosophy
* * *
You enhance your spell with elemental air, using the wind to find your target and carry your magic around cover. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that requires a spell attack roll, you ignore the target's [[Concealed|Concealed]] condition and any cover they have from you. The spell gains the air trait.
