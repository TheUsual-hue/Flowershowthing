## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Cleric]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Raise Symbol
* * *
**Trigger** While you have your symbol raised, you are about to take damage from a melee attack.

* * *

Your religious symbol glows with sacred energy, turning the attacker's strength to weakness. Attempt a Religion check check against the triggering creature's Will DC. Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until it spends at least 1 action moving away from you.

**Success** As critical success, but [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]].
