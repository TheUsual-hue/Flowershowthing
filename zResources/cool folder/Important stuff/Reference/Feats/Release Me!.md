# Release Me! `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** An enemy has you [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

Your retribution against one who would detain you is swift and dangerous. Make a melee Strike against the creature who has you [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. You can still make this attack even if you are restrained, though not if you are wielding a two-handed weapon. Unless your Strike is a critical failure, you can then attempt a check to [[Escape|Escape]]. If the creature who has you grabbed or restrained is the target of your Ultimatum of Liberation, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Both the Strike and the Escape count toward your multiple attack penalty, but it doesn't increase until you've made both rolls.
