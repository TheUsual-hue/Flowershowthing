# Running Tackle `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wrestler Dedication
* * *
You charge, throwing your body at your foe in a vicious tackle. Stride twice or make a [[High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Long Jump|Long Jump]], then attempt to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]]. If you made a High Jump or Long Jump, you can make the Grapple or Shove at any point in the jump, but you can't travel any farther on the jump after you do.
