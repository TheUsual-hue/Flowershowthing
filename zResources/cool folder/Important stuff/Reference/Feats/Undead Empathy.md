# Undead Empathy
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skeleton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your relationship with undeath gives you a stronger bond with other undead. You can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on mindless undead or make simple requests of them. As long as there aren't living creatures nearby, they usually let you speak. If the undead creature currently is in the thrall of a creature whose level is higher than yours, you typically need a critical success on your Diplomacy skill check.
