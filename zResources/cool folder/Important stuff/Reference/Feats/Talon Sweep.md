## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clawdancer Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** A creature attempts to Strike you while it's flanking you.

* * *

Your long clawed legs let you catch enemies to either side. You shift to talon stance if you weren't in it already. If the Strike misses, you can make a spinning talon Strike against any creature flanking you.
