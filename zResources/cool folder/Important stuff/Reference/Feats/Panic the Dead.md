# Panic the Dead
## Feat 2
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Cleric]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/emotion]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Fear]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mental]]

**Category** class; 




Vitality strikes terror in the undead. When you use a [[Heal|Heal]] spell to damage undead, any undead that fails its saving throw is also [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. If it critically failed, the creature also gains the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition until the start of your next turn. Mindless undead are not immune to this effect due to being mindless.
