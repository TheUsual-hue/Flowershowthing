## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Druid]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/sonic]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** storm order
* * *
Your lightning splits the air, generating a booming shock wave. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that has the electricity trait or deals electricity damage, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a saving throw, the force of the spell's lightning creates a thunderclap, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
