# Wave Spiral `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/water]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Reflective Ripple Stance
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** You're in Reflective Ripple Stance.

* * *

You dip and spin, unleashing a wide whirlpool of water. Make an Athletics check to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]] each creature standing on the ground in a 10-foot emanation.

These attacks all count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you make all the attacks.
