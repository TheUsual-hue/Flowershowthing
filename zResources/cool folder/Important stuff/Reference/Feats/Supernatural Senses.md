# Supernatural Senses
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Barbarian]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Acute Scent or scent
* * *
Your scent is preternaturally sharp, and you can always rely on your sense of smell to help guide you when your vision is compromised. When you target a [[Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] opponent while you are raging, you reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or to 9 for a hidden one.
