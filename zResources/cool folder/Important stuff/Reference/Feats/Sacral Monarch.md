**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sacral Lord; master in Occultism or Religion

You have come into your full powers and are truly a monarch of your realm, by your own definition at least. While in your territory, you can cast [[Banishment|Banishment]] and [[Inevitable Disaster|Inevitable Disaster]] as innate divine spells, each once per day.
