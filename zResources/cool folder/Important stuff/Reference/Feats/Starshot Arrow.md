## Feat 17

**Category** ancestry; 




The greatest centaurs need not wait until their stories are over to touch the stars in the sky. You draw an arrow (or other ammunition), whisper a short invocation over it, and then Strike with a ranged weapon. The arrow becomes a bolt of starlight, changing its damage to your choice of force or spirit and granting it the effects of the _[[Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]]_ rune. When the arrow Strikes its target, it unravels into a constellation of starlight that wraps around the target's limbs, imposing a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds or [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilizing]] it if the Strike was critical hit. The target can untangle itself by spending an Interact action to break free.
