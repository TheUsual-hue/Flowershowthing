# Musetouched
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your blood sings with the liberating power of the azatas, living embodiments of freedom from the wild realm of Elysium. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Escape|Escape]]. When you roll a critical failure on a check to Escape, you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
