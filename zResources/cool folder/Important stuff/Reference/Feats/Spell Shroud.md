# Spell Shroud `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Sorcerer]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




Your spell shrouds you in a billowing cloud. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that targets you, you surround yourself in a 15-foot emanation of dense magical mist that lasts until the start of your next turn. All creatures within the cloud become [[Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud are concealed to creatures within it.
