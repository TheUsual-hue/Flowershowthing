Seeing your allies falter, you fill their hearts with your unbreakable hope, rousing them to stay in the fight. All allies within 60 feet that are dying, or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and wounded, are healed a number of Hit Points equal to three times your level. Then, all allies within 60 feet that are [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] may stand up as a free action that does not provoke reactions.
