# Rough Rider
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/goblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are especially good at riding traditional goblin mounts. You gain the [[Ride|Ride]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Nature checks to use [[Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] on a goblin dog or wolf mount.

If you gain a wolf as an animal companion, it gains the mount special ability (and if you gain an ability that grants you an animal companion with the mount special ability, you can choose a wolf).
