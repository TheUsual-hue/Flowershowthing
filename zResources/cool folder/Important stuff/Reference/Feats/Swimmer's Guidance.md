# Swimmer's Guidance
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/merfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You're always ready to help those floundering in the water. Any ally who starts their turn within 30 feet of you and in the same body of water gains a 10-foot swim Speed until the end of their turn. If any ally affected by Swimmer's Guidance rolls a critical failure on an Athletics check to Swim, they get a failure instead.
