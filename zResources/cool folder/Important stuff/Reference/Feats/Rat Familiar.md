# Rat Familiar
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have a pet rat that has become magically bonded to you. You gain a familiar, and this familiar must be a rat. It still gets the benefits of familiar abilities, but its base form remains a rat.
