## Feat 2
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dexterity +3; trained in Acrobatics; trained in Athletics; trained with at least one of the following weapons: staff, bo staff, halfling sling staff, or any weapon in the spear or polearm group (referred to in this archetype as "your staff")
* * *
When you [[High Jump|High Jump]], [[Leap|Leap]], or [[Long Jump|Long Jump]] while wielding your staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any Athletics check required and add 5 feet to the distance you can Leap vertically and horizontally. You can [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]] and [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]] even if you don't have a free hand, provided you are wielding your staff. Finally, when you roll a success on a check to [[Balance|Balance]] while wielding your staff, you get a critical success instead.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Staff Acrobat|Staff Acrobat]] archetype.
