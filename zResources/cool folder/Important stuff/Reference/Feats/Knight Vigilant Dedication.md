You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels. You gain expert proficiency in Religion. When you are between an ally and a foe and would provide lesser cover to your ally against the foe's attacks, you twist to become even more obtrusive, providing standard cover instead.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Knight Vigilant|Knight Vigilant]] archetype.
