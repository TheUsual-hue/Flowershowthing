# Rat Magic
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




There always seems to be a little rat around to carry messages for you. You can cast [[Animal Messenger|Animal Messenger]] once per day as a primal innate spell. When you do, the animal that responds is always a rat. If there are no rats within range, the spell is lost.
