### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Ranger]]

**Category** class; 




By adopting resonant reflections, you have learned to copy the abilities of other creatures as well. When you use [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] on a foe within 100 feet, you gain resistance 10 to all damage types that target has resistance or immunity to for as long as the foe remains within 100 feet.
