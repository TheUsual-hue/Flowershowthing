With a mighty blow from atop your companion, you attempt to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee Strike against a mounted creature. If your attack hits, attempt an Athletics check check against the target's Fortitude DC. If you succeed, the target is knocked off its mount into a space of its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, the target also lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
