# Untrained Improvisation
## Feat 3
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/general]]

**Category** general; 




You've learned how to handle situations when you're out of your depth. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks is equal to your level –2. This improves to your level –1 at 5th level and your full level at 7th level. This doesn't allow you to use the skill's trained actions.
