# Slay `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Avenger Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your target is [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 2]] or greater.

* * *

You finish your target with a vicious attack. Make a Strike against the target. If you hit, the target takes 4d6 extra precision damage with a Fortitude check save against your class DC. If the target critically fails, they die. This is an incapacitation effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your Slay for 1 day.
