# Scrutinizing Gaze
## Feat 13
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

Your family's traditions of defending against Geb's undead have granted you a sixth sense for detecting spirits, haunts, and other restless dead, no matter their form or the strength of their presence. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] when trying to determine if a creature is possessed or under the influence of an effect that would make them controlled, a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks made to see through disguises worn by undead, and a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [[Seek|Seek]] action to find [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or undetected haunts or undead within 30 feet of you.

If you aren't using the Seek action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts or undead within 30 feet anyway. This check doesn't gain the usual +2 circumstance bonus, and instead takes a -2 circumstance penalty.
