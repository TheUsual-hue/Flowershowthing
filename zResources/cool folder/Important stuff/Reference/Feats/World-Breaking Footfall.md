# World-Breaking Footfall `pf2:2`
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Kaiju Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Kaiju Stance|Kaiju Stance]] and are touching the ground.

* * *

You slam the ground and unleash a fearsome roar, sending broken shards of earth flying in all directions. The ground in a 20-foot emanation around you becomes difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain if it was already difficult terrain. All other creatures within the emanation take 7d6 bludgeoning damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC. You then can't use World-breaking Footfall for 1d4.
