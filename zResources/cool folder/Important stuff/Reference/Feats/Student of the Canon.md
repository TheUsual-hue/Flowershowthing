## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/general]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Religion
* * *
You've researched many faiths enough to recognize notions about them that are unlikely to be true. If you roll a critical failure at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure instead. When attempting to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
