# Sash of the Wind
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/uncommon.md "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** Tian Xia origin

At your request, the nature spirits of the air and wind spin themselves into an iridescent sash loosely draped around your shoulders that buoys you through the sky. You can cast [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Fly|Fly]] on yourself as a 4th-rank innate primal spell once per day. If the sash created by this feat is removed, the spell immediately ends.
