**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You have a focus pool.

As your ability to control your mythic power grows, you learn to channel it to restore and reinforce other forms of power at your command. Spend a Mythic Point; you immediately recover all your Focus Points, filling your focus pool to its current maximum.
