# Quick Reversal `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/press]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are flanked by at least two enemies.

* * *

You turn your foes' flanking against them with a quick reverse. Make a melee Strike against one of the flanking enemies and make a second Strike with the same weapon or unarmed attack against a different enemy that is flanking you. This second Strike has the same multiple attack penalty of the initial attack and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
