# Overpowering Charge
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Barbarian]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Fighter]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Barreling Charge
* * *
You trample your foes as you charge past them. When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature's space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. If you critically succeed, the creature takes double this amount of damage and becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn.
