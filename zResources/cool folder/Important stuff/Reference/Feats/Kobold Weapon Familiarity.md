# Kobold Weapon Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the kobold trait. You have familiarity with weapons with the kobold trait plus the greatpick, light pick, and pickâ€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
