## Feat 16
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archfiend Dedication
* * *
You can teleport across the battlefield, disappearing and appearing in a burst of hellfire and brimstone, a flash of lightning, a cloud of caustic gas, or other environmental hazard common within your planned realm. You can cast translocate as a 4th-rank divine innate spell at will. When you do, spaces adjacent to the one you leave from and the one you appear in are momentarily filled with a damaging energy common to your realm, dealing 4d6 untyped damage of your realm's damage type to creatures in the affected spaces (Reflex check save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).
