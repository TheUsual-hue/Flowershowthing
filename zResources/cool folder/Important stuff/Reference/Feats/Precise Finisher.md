# Precise Finisher
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Confident Finisher
* * *
Even when your foe avoids your [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Confident Finisher|Confident Finisher]], you can still hit a vital spot. On a failure with Confident Finisher, you apply your full precise strike damage instead of half.
