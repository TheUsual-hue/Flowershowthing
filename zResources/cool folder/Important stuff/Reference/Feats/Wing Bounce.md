**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication
* * *
You rush forward, flapping your wings for a bit of lift, and can use that momentum to knock down a foe. [[Leap|Leap]], and if you land within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can attempt to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]] that enemy. You don't need to have one hand free. If you successfully knock the target [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], you can Leap again. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly instead of Leap.
