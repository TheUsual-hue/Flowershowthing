# Monk's Flurry
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Monk Dedication
* * *
You gain the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]] action. Your fists' power, however, exceeds your conditioning; once you use Flurry of Blows, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds as your muscles recover.
