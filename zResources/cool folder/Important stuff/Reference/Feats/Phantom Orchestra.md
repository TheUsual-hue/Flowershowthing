# Phantom Orchestra
## Feat 9
### [[Tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




An easy way to trick others is to throw your voice into a nearby forest or thicket to make strange noises. You can cast 2nd-rank [[Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]] as an innate primal spell once per day. You can also cast the [[Figment|Figment]] cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
