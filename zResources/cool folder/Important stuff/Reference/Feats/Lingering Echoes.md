# Lingering Echoes
## Feat 9
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Not everyone is reincarnated, and you feel a strong connection with the spiritual echoes of those who didn't receive the same opportunity as you. You gain [[Talking Corpse|Talking Corpse]] as an occult innate spell that you can cast once per day. You can ask a fourth question of a corpse when you cast this spell. The corpse attempts its Will check save against your spell DC or your class DC, whichever is higher.
