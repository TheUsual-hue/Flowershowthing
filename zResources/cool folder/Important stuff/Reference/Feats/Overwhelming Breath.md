**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Qi Spells
* * *
You control your breathing and align it with your qi, exhaling with controlled force in order to overcome your opponent's resistance. If you use your next action to Cast a Spell that has the monk trait and no duration, the spell and any Strikes you make as a result of casting it ignore an amount of the target's resistance to physical damage equal to your level.
