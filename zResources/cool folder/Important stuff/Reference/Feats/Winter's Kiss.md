# Winter's Kiss
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 




Whether in the heart of a volcanic passageway or the glacial tundras of the Crown of the World, the only temperature you ever personally experience is an oddly comfortable chill. You are now protected from extreme cold and extreme heat, and you gain resistance to fire equal to half your level. If you would already have resistance to fire equal to half your level from a heritage, ancestry feat, class feat, or another archetype feat, you instead gain resistance to fire equal to your level.
