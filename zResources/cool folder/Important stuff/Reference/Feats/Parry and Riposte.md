# Parry and Riposte
## Feat 18
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Opportune Riposte
* * *
Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest provocation.

You can use [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Opportune Riposte|Opportune Riposte]] against an enemy who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically fails), provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC from the parry weapon trait or [[Extravagant Parry|Extravagant Parry]].
