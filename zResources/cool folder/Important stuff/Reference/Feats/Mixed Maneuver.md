# Mixed Maneuver `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** master in Athletics
* * *
You leverage your knowledge of martial arts to mix different maneuvers together into a single flowing combination. Choose any two of [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Reposition|Reposition]], [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]], and [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Trip|Trip]]. Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.
