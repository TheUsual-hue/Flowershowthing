# Natural Senses
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have retained your sharp animal senses even after awakening. Choose one of the following senses appropriate to your kind of animal: darkvision, echolocation 10 feet, low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet, or tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet. (Echolocation allows you to use hearing as a precise sense at the listed range.) If your animal kind doesn't typically have a specific type of sense, you can't gain that sense with this feat.

**Special** You can take this feat multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.
