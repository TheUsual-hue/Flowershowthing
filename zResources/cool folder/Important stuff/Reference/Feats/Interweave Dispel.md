# Interweave Dispel `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Sorcerer]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** dispel magic in your spell repertoire
* * *
You weave dispelling energy into a spell. If your next action is to cast a single-target spell against an enemy, and you either hit the enemy with the spell attack roll or the enemy fails its saving throw, you can cast [[Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] on the enemy as a free action, expending a spell slot as normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the enemy.
