# Reflexive Grapple `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Thlipit Contestant Dedication
* * *
You've honed your reflexes so well that your lash can begin closing around a target as soon as it makes contact. Make a lash Strike; if the Strike hits, you can immediately attempt to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the target. Both actions count toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you've made both attacks.
