# Snare Commando `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception or Intimidation; Snare Crafting
* * *
**Trigger** A creature fails or critically fails a save against your snare.

* * *

Your snares are so befuddling that your victims rarely notice you slipping out of sight. If you have expert proficiency in Deception, you can Create a Diversion against the triggering creature. If you have expert proficiency in Intimidation, you can instead Demoralize the triggering creature. If you have both, choose one of the two effects.
