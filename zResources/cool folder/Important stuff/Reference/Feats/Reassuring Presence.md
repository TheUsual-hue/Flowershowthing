# Reassuring Presence `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/anadi]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/auditory]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet gains the frightened condition.

* * *

You serve as an anchor to your close companions, calming them in times of stress. Decrease the value of the triggering ally's [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition by 1. The ally is then temporarily immune to your Reassuring Presence for 1 hour.
