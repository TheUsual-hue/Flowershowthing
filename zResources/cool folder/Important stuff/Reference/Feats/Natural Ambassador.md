**Prerequisites** awakened mind

You remember what it was like to speak easily with other animals, using old, familiar ways of communication to learn what they want and ask for favors in return. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with all animals, not just those of your kind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy when you do, or a +2 circumstance bonus with animals of your kind.
