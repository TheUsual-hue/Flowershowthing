## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication

You learn the freedom ritual. If you spend an additional Mythic Point while casting it, you reduce its casting time to 1 hour, and both the primary and secondary casters attempt their corresponding skill checks at mythic proficiency. If you would critically fail the ritual, you fail instead. Additionally, you gain the [[Unimpeded Stride|Unimpeded Stride]] and [[Word of Freedom|Word of Freedom]] domain spells. These are focus spells, granting you a focus pool of 2 Focus Points or expanding that pool if you already have one. You can Refocus while you meditate on the concepts of freedom and liberty.
