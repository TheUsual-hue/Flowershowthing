# Scout's Charge `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Scout Dedication

You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning.

Choose one enemy. Stride, [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Feint|Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a Strike against it. For your Feint, you can attempt a [[/act feint skill=stealth]]{Stealth} check instead of the Deception check that's usually required, using the terrain around you to surprise your foe.
