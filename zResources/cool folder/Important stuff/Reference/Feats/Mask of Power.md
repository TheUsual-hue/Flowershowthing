# Mask of Power
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Orc Warmask
* * *
Your _warmask_ sharpens your connection to the source of your mask's power. During your daily preparations, choose [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Fear|Fear]], [[Phantom Pain|Phantom Pain]], or [[Sure Strike|Sure Strike]].

Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this spell as a 1st-rank innate spell once per day; the spell's tradition is determined by the tradition tied to your _warmask_. You must be wearing your _warmask_ to Cast the Spell.
