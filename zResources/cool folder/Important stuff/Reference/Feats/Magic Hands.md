# Magic Hands
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Healing Hands
* * *
The blessing of your deity heightens your healing ability, integrating magical healing with the mundane. When you succeed at a Medicine check to [[Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], you can roll d10s instead of d8s for the healing and add a status bonus to the healing equal to your level.
