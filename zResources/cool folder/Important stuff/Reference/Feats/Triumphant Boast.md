You relate a loud and impressive tale of your triumph over a formidable foe. When you [[Perform|Perform]], choose a single target within 30 feet of you and compare the result of your Performance check to that observer's Will DC. If you're a master in Performance, you can choose up to four targets, and if you're legendary, you can choose any number of targets. If you succeed, any attempt made by you to [[Demoralize|Demoralize]] that creature within the next 24 hours gains a +1 circumstance bonus. If your Charisma score is 20 or higher and you're a master in Performance, this bonus increases to +2. Once a creature is boasted at in this manner, it becomes temporarily immune to further Triumphant Boasts for 24 hours.
