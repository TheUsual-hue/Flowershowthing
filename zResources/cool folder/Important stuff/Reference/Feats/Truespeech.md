It is paramount that you are understood and you understand others; language need not impede your message.

You can cast [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Truespeech|Truespeech]] as a 5th-rank divine innate spell once per day on yourself only.

You gain a +1 status bonus to Diplomacy checks for the duration of the spell when speaking to creatures with whom you already shared a language before casting.
