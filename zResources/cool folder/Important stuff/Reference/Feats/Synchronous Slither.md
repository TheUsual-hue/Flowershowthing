# Synchronous Slither `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** An ally within your reach leaves a square during a move action they're using and ends their movement adjacent to an enemy.

* * *

You've learned to travel at your ally's rhythm and use their movement to adjust your own position. You Stride up to half your speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions from the enemy your ally moved adjacent to.
