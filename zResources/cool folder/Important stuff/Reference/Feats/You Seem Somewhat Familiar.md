## Feat 9
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You succeed or critically succeed at a [[Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check about a creature.

* * *

You fought hundreds of foes in your various past lives, and now and then, something about a new opponent tugs at your memory, almost as if you defeated their grandparent long ago. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw against this creature. You only receive this bonus once per creature.
