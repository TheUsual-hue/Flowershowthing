# Lucky Break
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Cat's Luck
* * *
You are luckier even than most catfolk. You can trigger [[Cat's Luck|Cat's Luck]] when you fail or critically fail a Fortitude saving throw, Will saving throw, Acrobatics check, or Athletics check in addition to Reflex saving throws. You still can use Cat's Luck only once per day.
