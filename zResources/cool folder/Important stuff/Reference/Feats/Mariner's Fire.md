# Mariner's Fire
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/tengu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You conjure uncanny orbs of spiritual flame that float above or below the water's surface. You can cast the [[Ignition|Ignition]] cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. Your ignition spell takes the form of orbs of fire, and you can cast it underwater.
