Stealth is an important tool in your arsenal. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the [[Sneak|Sneak]] action, up to your Speed.

In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions and succeed at your Stealth check, you don't become observed if you don't have cover or greater cover and aren't [[Concealed|Concealed]] at the end of the Sneak action, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are concealed at the end of your turn.
