**Category** class; 




You have a knack for drawing the right card, be it from a harrow deck, in a game of cards, or even when drawing from a [[Deck of Many Things|Deck of Many Things]]. When you're attempting a skill check involving the drawing of cards or resolving the effects of a divination effect (including attempting a saving throw against a hostile divination effect against you), you gain a +2 status bonus to the check. When you draw a card to determine your harrow omen, perform Harrow Casting, cast [[Harrowing|Harrowing]], or if you activate a magical deck of cards, draw 2 cards, and choose the one you prefer as your actual card drawn. You can even use this ability when drawing from a Deck of Many Things, but only once per deck. The unused card is shuffled back into the stack.
