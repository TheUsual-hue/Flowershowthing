**Category** class; 




You shape your kinetic aura into swirling armor of steam that scalds your enemies and propels you on super-heated jet streams. A creature can take damage from Steam Knight only once per round. Your steam armor has the following effects.

*   You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed.
*   When you [[Leap|Leap]], you can jump up to your Speed. You don't immediately fall at the end of a jump, provided you Leap again with your next action. If you Leap over a creature and come within 10 feet, that creature takes 1d6 fire damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC.
*   At the start of each of your turns, you can emit steam as a free action. It deals 1d6 fire damage to each creature in your kinetic aura with a Reflex check save against your class DC. A creature that fails is also pushed 5 feet.

* * *

**Level (+5)** The fire damage from a jump or blast of steam increases by 1d6.
