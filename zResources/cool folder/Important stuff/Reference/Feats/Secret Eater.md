# Secret Eater
## Feat 12

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghoul Dedication; worshipper of Kabriri
* * *
You have discovered and found favor with the cult within the church of Kabriri known as the Secret Eaters. You have maggots that writhe under your skin with the power to wriggle out from between your teeth, glean secrets from those you devour, and whisper them telepathically into your mind. Once per hour when you Consume Flesh, you can select a single Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill whose secrets you wish to uncover. You become subject to the effects of corpse communion as if you had critically succeeded at casting the ritual: you learn a significant piece of lore, a forgotten secret, or some other tantalizing nugget of knowledge that is of immediate use to you.
