# Tail Guard `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Thlipit Contestant Dedication; unarmed attack with your tail
* * *
**Trigger** A creature enters a square that would flank you.

* * *

Enemies who attempt to stab you in the back will be unhappy to find your lashing tail on guard. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit, the movement is disrupted. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
