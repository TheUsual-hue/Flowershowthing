# Inner Fire (Naari)
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/naari]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can call the fire inside you into the palm of your hand. You can cast the [[Produce Flame|Produce Flame]] cantrip as an innate primal or arcane spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
