# Secondary Adaptation
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/surki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've continued to adapt to the rigors of your environment by continuing your metamorphosis, even as an adult. Choose one surki heritage that you don't already have; you gain that heritage and its benefits.
