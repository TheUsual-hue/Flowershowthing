# Wortwitch
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Witch]]

**Category** class; 




You have a particular affinity for leafy plants.

Your patron grants you a leshy familiar. If you already had a familiar, this leshy replaces your previous familiar, as if your previous familiar had been slain.

In addition, you gain the ability to see through leaves, vines, and other foliage. You don't take circumstance penalties to ranged spell attacks or Perception checks caused by foliage, and your targeted attacks don't require a flat check to succeed against a target [[Concealed|Concealed]] only by such vegetation.
