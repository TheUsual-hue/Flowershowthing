### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/merfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Being part fish yourself, you can speak the language of the sea. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals that have the amphibious trait, aquatic trait, or a swim Speed, such as fish, crabs, and some seabirds (like penguins). The GM determines which animals count for this ability.
