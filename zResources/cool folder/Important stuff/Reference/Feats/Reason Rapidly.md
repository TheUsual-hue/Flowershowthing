# Reason Rapidly `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Investigator]]

**Category** class; 




Your mind works through clues at an unbelievable speed. You instantly use up to five [[Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] actions. If you have any special abilities or free actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can't use them for these actions.
