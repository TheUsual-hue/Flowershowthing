**Category** class; 




**Trigger** Your size increases due to a polymorph effect.

* * *

The physical growth of your transformation is a spectacle that shakes foes to their core. Each enemy smaller than your new size within 30 feet of you must attempt a Will check save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]], and you can push it up to 10 feet from you. This is forced movement.
