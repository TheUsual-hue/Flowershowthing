# Medic Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Medicine; Battle Medicine
* * *
You become an expert in Medicine. When you succeed with [[Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] or [[Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], the target gains a circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points they regain equal to 5 HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40.

Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature that's temporarily immune due to having already been treated with Battle Medicine. If you're a master in Medicine, you can do so once per hour.
