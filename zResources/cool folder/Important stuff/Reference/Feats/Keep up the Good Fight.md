# Keep up the Good Fight
## Feat 14
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Vigilant Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** A foe's Strike reduces you to 0 Hit Points.

**Requirements** You had more than 1 Hit Point before the triggering Strike, and the Strike wouldn't kill you.

* * *

Your devotion to helping others and doing good keeps you going, even against insurmountable odds. Instead of being knocked out, you are reduced to 1 Hit Point, gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level for 1 round, and increase your wounded value by 1.
