## Feat 17
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/manipulate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/merfolk]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth the sleeping krakens of the deep to crush your enemies. You open a dozen small portals to some lightless, watery abyss in a 30-foot burst within 120 feet. The powerful tentacles of a kraken reach through to grab at each creature in the area. Each affected creature takes 8d6 untyped damage depending on its Fortitude check save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can Sustain the call up to 1 minute. The first time you Sustain it on each subsequent turn, each creature in the area not already [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the tentacles must attempt the save.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is grabbed by a tentacle. A creature that's still grabbed by a tentacle at the end of its turn takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. The tentacles' [[Escape|Escape]] DC and AC are both equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature can attack a tentacle to attempt to free the creature trapped by it; a tentacle is destroyed if it takes 30 or more damage in a single round.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but double damage.
