# Mortal Healing
## Feat 2
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/general]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Godless Healing; You follow the Laws of Mortality
* * *
You grant greater healing when the gods don't interfere. When you roll a success to [[Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] for a creature that hasn't regained Hit Points from divine magic in the past 24 hours, you get a critical success on your check instead and restore the corresponding amount of Hit Points.
