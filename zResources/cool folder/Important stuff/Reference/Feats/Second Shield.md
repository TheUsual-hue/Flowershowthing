# Second Shield `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Viking Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** Your [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] causes your shield to break or be destroyed.

* * *

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself.

You can [[Interact|Interact]] to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield-for example, a table or chair-you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield.

Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [[Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] action, as normal.
