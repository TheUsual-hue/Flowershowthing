# Reflect Foe
## Feat 17
### [[zTemplates/New folder/Bestiary/zz_traits/reflection]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You create a copy of a foe by calling them forth from a nearby reflection, clonally growing them in an instant from one of your hairs or otherwise creating them in a way that matches your own nature as a reflection. You can cast [[Duplicate Foe|Duplicate Foe]] once per day as an innate occult spell. At 20th level, your innate _duplicate foe_ is heightened to 8th level.
