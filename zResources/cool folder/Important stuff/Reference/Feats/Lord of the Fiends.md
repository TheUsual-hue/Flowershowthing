### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archfiend Dedication

You consider every fiend a future subject and can assess them at a glance. Spend a Mythic Point. Attempt a check at mythic proficiency to Recall Knowledge about every fiend you can see. For the next hour, whenever you roll a success on a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check against a fiend, you get a critical success instead.
