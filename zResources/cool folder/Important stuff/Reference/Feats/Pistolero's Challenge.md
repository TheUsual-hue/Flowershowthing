**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Way of the Pistolero
* * *
With a stern call, carefully chosen barb, or some other challenging declaration, you demand your foe's attention in a duel. Choose an opponent within 30 feet who you can perceive and can hear you, and make your choice of a Deception check or Intimidation check check against the target's Will DC. No matter the result of the check, the foe is temporarily immune to your Pistolero's Challenge until noon the next day.

You can have only one challenge in effect at a time; challenging a new opponent ends this effect on any current target. Otherwise, the effect lasts until one of you is defeated, flees, or the encounter ends.

**Success** Both you and the opponent gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with Strikes made against each other. If you're a master in the skill you used for the check, the status bonus to damage rolls increases to +3, and if you're legendary, it increases to +4.

**Critical Failure** You become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and can't use this ability again for 1 minute.
