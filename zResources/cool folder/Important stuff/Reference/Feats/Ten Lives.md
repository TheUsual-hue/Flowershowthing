# Ten Lives
## Feat 17
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Evade Doom

When your character would die, you can attempt a DC 17 Flat check. On a success, you're instead reduced to 0 HP and a [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] value 1 less than what would normally kill you (typically dying 3). This doesn't change the result for any other creature affected.
