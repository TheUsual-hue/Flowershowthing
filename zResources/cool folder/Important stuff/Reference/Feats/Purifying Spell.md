**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** wave order

You purify the water within a creature's body to cleanse them of illness. If the next action you use is to cast [[Heal|Heal]] targeting a single living creature, you can attempt to counteract a disease or poison affecting the target, in addition to the other benefits of _heal_. If you do, _heal_ gains the water trait.
