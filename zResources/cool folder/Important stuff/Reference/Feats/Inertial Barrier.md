# Inertial Barrier
## Feat 6
### [[amp]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/occult]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Psychic]]

**Category** class; 




Your spell leaves behind barriers that reduce shock and motion. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry.

**Amp** You or one target of the spell gains resistance to physical damage equal to 2 + the spell's rank until the start of your next turn.
