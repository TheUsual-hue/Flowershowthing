* * *
Whether they have heard of your legend or seen your prowess on the field of battle, those already quaking in their boots grow weak when forced to stand against you. You gain resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage against Strikes made by creatures with the frightened condition. This resistance is equal to four times the value of that creature's frightened condition. When this resistance applies to at least one of a creature's Strikes during their turn, that creature doesn't reduce the value of their frightened condition at the end of their turn.
