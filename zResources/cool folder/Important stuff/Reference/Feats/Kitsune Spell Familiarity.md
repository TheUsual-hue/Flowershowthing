**Category** ancestry; 




You've picked up a few magical tricks. During your daily preparations, choose [[Daze|Daze]], [[Forbidding Ward|Forbidding Ward]], or [[Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]]. Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
