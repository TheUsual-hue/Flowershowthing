# Magic Sense (Magus)
## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/arcane]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/detection]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Magus]]

**Category** class; 




You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.

You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-rank [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only.

When you [[Seek|Seek]], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-rank _detect magic_ spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
