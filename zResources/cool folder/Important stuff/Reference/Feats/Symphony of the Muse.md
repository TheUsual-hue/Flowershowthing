# Symphony of the Muse
## Feat 20
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Bard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Harmonize
* * *
You have learned how to weave countless performances together into a solo symphony with multitudinous effects. You are no longer limited to a single composition each turn or a single composition at a time; when you use a new composition, all previous compositions' effects continue for their remaining duration.
