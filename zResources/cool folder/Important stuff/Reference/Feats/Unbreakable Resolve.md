# Unbreakable Resolve `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/fortune]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** You fail a Will save.

* * *

The experience of coming back after death has granted you a strong sense of resolve; devilish words, slick spells, and conniving trickery can't easily catch you off guard. Reroll the triggering save, using the second result only if it's better.
