# Roiling Mudslide `pf2:2`

**Category** class; 




You form water and earth into a mudslide that smashes your opponents and coats them in mud. Each creature in a 30-foot cone takes 0d8 bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude check save against your class DC. A creature that fails is also pushed 5 feet (or 10 feet on a critical failure) and coated in mud until the end of its next turn. While coated in mud, the creature falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] at the end of its movement any time it ends a move action other than a [[Crawl|Crawl]] or Step. The creature can attempt an Acrobatics check or Reflex check save against your class DC, avoiding the fall if it succeeds.

**Level (+4)** The damage increases by 1d8.
