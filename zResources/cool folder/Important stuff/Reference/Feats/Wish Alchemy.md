# Wish Alchemy
## Feat 20
### [rare](cool%20folder/Important%20stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/rare.md "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You have learned Artokus Kirran's most hidden secrets, granting you the ability to create alchemy infused with the power of wishes.

Once per day when you use [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Class Features/Advanced Alchemy|Advanced Alchemy]] during your daily preparations, you can spend a batch of infused reagents to create a wish vial containing a single common arcane spell of your choice of 8th level or lower.

The spell must have a casting time of no more than 3 actions, no Cost, and must be able to target you. Only you can Activate the wish vial, which takes the same number of [[Interact|Interact]] actions as the spell's casting time and grants you the effects of the spell.
