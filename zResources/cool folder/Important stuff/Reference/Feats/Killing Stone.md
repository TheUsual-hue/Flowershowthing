# Killing Stone
## Feat 13
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/kitsune]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Star Orb
* * *
Your star orb hides a deadly miasma. You can cast 5th-rank [[Toxic Cloud|Toxic Cloud]] as a divine innate spell once per day. The spell's normal components are replaced with a focus component (your star orb) and a somatic component to aim the orb towards the location for the spell.
