You've sworn an oath to defend the helpless from dangerous titanic beasts, including kaiju that roam the surface of Golarion. Attacks made as part of your [[Overwhelming Combination|Overwhelming Combination]] ability gain a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against a creature at least 2 sizes larger than you, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws and DCs against kaiju hazards. You gain the following edict.

**Edict** You must do everything within your power to protect others from massive creatures they can't defend themselves from; in the event the victims are evil or actively trying to harm you or other innocents, you don't have to save them.
