You can translate the emotion and power of a composition to other mediums. If your next action is to cast a composition spell that is auditory or visual, you can have it affect creatures who can witness it with any sense, not just those the traits indicate, even including special senses like tremorsense. You can choose to exclude any senses you choose.
