# Sense for Trouble
## Feat 9
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Cat's Luck
* * *
You can tell when something's off. You can trigger [[Cat's Luck|Cat's Luck]] after you roll initiative, in addition to its normal trigger, to reroll your Initiative and take the higher of the two results.

This still counts against Cat's Luck's frequency, as normal.
