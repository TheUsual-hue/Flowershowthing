You spoil the food and water nearby, even within your foes' bodies. Spend a Mythic Point. Enemies within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude check save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. You also cause edible food to rot and potable water to turn brackish within the area. Choose a number of potions or alchemical elixirs within the area equal to your key attribute modifier and attempt a counteract against each of them using Occultism or Religion at mythic proficiency. Your counteract rank is half your level. If you succeed, the elixir or potion spoils and becomes a mundane item.
