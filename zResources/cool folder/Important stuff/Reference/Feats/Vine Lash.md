# Vine Lash `pf2:1`
## Feat 2

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You have a free hand.

* * *

A long vine sprouts from your arm, which you can temporarily wield like a whip. Make a melee attack roll against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the vine deals 0d6 slashing damage for every 2 levels you have to the target, or double damage on a success.

**Awakening** The vine coils around your foes, squeezing them lifeless. On a successful hit, the target is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the vine. The DC to [[Escape|Escape]] the vine is equal to your Class DC or Spell DC, whichever is higher. Each round on your turn, if the target is still grabbed, the vine squeezes them, dealing 0d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels you have.

**Awakening** Rather than lash at your foes with a single vine, dozens of writhing vines emerge from your hands, lashing all creatures in a large area. You can use Vine Lash as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a Reflex check save.
