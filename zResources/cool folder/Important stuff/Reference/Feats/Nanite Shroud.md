# Nanite Shroud `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/android]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud.

You become [[Concealed|Concealed]] for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can't use this concealment to [[Hide|Hide]] or [[Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.

While Nanite Shroud is active, you can't use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.
