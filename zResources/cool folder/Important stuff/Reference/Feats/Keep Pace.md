**Bounty Hunter -** Once you are upon your prey, they can't escape.

**Game Hunter** - When your hunted prey tries to bolt, you follow.

[[Stride|Stride]] up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to [[Burrow|Burrow]], [[Climb|Climb]], [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Basic Actions/Fly|Fly]], or [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Swim|Swim]] instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
