# Knowledge is Power
## Feat 6
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Magus]]

**Category** class; 




When you critically succeed at a Recall Knowledge check about a creature, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against the creature, to your AC against its next attack roll, and to your save against its next effect requiring a save.

If you share this information with your allies, they gain the benefits as well. If not used, these bonuses end after 1 minute.
