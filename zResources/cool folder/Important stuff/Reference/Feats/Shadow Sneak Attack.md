# Shadow Sneak Attack
## Feat 10
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Shadowdancer Dedication
* * *
You gain the [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Class Features/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]] class feature, except you deal 1d6 precision damage regardless of your level.

Sneak attack from multiple sources isn't cumulative. If you have sneak attack from more than one source, use only the highest number of dice when you sneak attack rather than adding the amounts together.
