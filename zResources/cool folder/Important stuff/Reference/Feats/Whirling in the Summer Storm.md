## Feat 12
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Twisting Petal Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You're in [[Twisting Petal Stance|Twisting Petal Stance]].

Your hands move in a hypnotic and distracting flurry that throws your foes off-balance before you cast them away with a violent pirouette.

You Step. Then each enemy within your reach must attempt a Will check save against the higher of your class DC or your Deception DC; on a failure, they're [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to melee attacks from you and your allies until the end of your next turn. Then, [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]] up to three adjacent enemies; each Shove counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your penalty until after you've resolved all the Shove attempts.
