# Versatile Performance
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Bard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** polymath muse
* * *
You can rely on the grandeur of your performances rather than ordinary social skills. You can use Performance instead of Diplomacy to [[/act make-an-impression statistic=performance]] and instead of Intimidation to [[/act demoralize statistic=performance]]. You can also use an acting Performance instead of Deception to [[/act impersonate statistic=performance]].

In addition, you can use your proficiency rank in Performance to meet the prerequisites of skill feats that require a particular proficiency rank in Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation.
