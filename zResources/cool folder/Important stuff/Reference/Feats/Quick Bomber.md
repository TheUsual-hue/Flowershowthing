# Quick Bomber `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You keep your bombs and bomb-related reagents in easy-toreach pouches from which you draw without thinking. You Interact to draw a bomb, draw a versatile vial, or use [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] to create a bomb, then [[Strike|Strike]] with the bomb. If you have the ability to create more than one bomb at a time with Quick Alchemy (such as from the double brew class feature), you can Strike with only one of the bombs you create with this action.
