To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you use a type of Performance. If the spell requires an auditory performance, you might recite a poem, sing a song, or perform a dramatic monologue. If the spell requires a visual performance, you might dance or pantomime. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.
