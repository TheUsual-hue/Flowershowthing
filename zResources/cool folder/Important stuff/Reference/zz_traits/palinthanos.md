When a cosmic event like Godsrain disturbs all that exists, the River of Souls sometimes flows backward for a brief moment, literally, from the shockwave. Unwilling and confused souls that are forced back far enough can have the agonizing experience of enduring death in reversed time. Some of these souls manage to re-enter the river once the flow returns to normal, but those who are stranded on the metaphorical shores of the living can become palinthanos: powerful undead born from their reversed demise who struggle futilely until their predestined banishment back to the River.
