When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attribute modifiers, either increasing it by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever grants the higher modifier. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it's invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don't gain the attribute modifier increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item.
