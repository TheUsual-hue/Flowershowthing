Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as duskwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to duskwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.
