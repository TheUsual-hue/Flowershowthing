The Lightkeeper can use a Certain Kill Art as long as they are within the Glass Lighthouseâ€”these abilities, which have the certain kill trait, cause obvious distortions in the Lighthouse's fabric as the user calls upon their technique. However, as each technique requires one of the Lightkeepers to temporarily take command of the demiplane from the rest of their team, only one Certain Kill Art can be used by any of the Lightkeepers in a given round.
