A construct is an artificial creature empowered by a force other than vitality or void. Constructs are often mindless; they are immune to bleed, death effects, disease, healing, nonlethal attacks, poison, spirit, vitality, void, and the doomed, drained, fatigued, paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious conditions; and they may have Hardness based on the materials used to construct their bodies. Constructs are not living creatures, nor are they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a construct creature is destroyed.
