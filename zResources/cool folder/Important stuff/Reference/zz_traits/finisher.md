Finishers are spectacular finishing moves. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. If your finisher succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead.
