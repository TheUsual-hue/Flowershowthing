Wandering identifies animist feats attuned to particular types of apparitions. These feats require you to have attuned to an apparition who matches their prerequisites when you select them, and represent knowledge and ability pulled from that specific bond. When you make your daily preparations, you can retrain any wandering feat you know for any other wandering feat available at the level you took the exchanged feat (including lower-level wandering feats, as usual). You must meet all the new featâ€™s other prerequisites.
