A hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention. Your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call.
