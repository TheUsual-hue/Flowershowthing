Transcendence channels the might of an exemplarâ€™s divine spark through one of their ikons to surpass the mortal and enact a miraculous deed. Each ikon has an action with the transcendence trait, and using it is called Sparking Transcendence. To use the action, your divine spark must be empowering that ikon and you must have the ikon ready to use (typically holding a weapon ikon or wearing a worn ikon). Immediately after you Spark Transcendence, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon, coming to rest in another ikon of your choice. You can Spark Transcendence only once each round. As it comes from your divine spark, a transcendence action has the divine trait.
