## Item 3
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/cavalry]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




_**Note**: Basic cavalry armies know Overrun automatically, and must 'spend' their first tactic on it._

Cavalry armies gain a +1 status bonus on weapon attacks against infantry and skirmisher armies, but they suffer a â€“1 status penalty on Maneuver and Morale saves against area attacks and mental attacks.
