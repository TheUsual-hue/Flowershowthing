# Keep up the Pressure
## Item 3
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/cavalry]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/infantry]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/siege]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skirmisher]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




The commander's swift, decisive directions help the army attack more accurately. If an army attacks the same target a second time in a round, its multiple attack penalty is –4 rather than –5, and if they attack that same army a third time in a round, its multiple attack penalty is –8 rather than –10.
