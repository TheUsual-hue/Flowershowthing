**Category** army-tactic; 




The army is trained to be self-sufficient and sustains itself via hunting and gathering when they're in the wild. If during a Kingdom turn's Upkeep phase this army is located in a hex that doesn't include a settlement, and if the army is not garrisoned, it reduces its Consumption by 1.
