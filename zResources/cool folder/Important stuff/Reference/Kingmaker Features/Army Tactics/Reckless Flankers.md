# Reckless Flankers
## Item 5
### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/cavalry]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skirmisher]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




Your army is skilled at surrounding their foes and distracting them, at the cost of spreading out too much and being more vulnerable. When you use the [[Kingmaker Features/Advance|Advance]] war action to successfully engage an army, you can choose to take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to your AC in order to gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls. If you do so, these modifiers remain in effect until you are no longer engaged.

You can use the [[Kingmaker Features/Outflank|Outflank]] tactical war action.
