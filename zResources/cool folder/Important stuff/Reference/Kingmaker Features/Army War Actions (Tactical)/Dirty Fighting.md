# Dirty Fighting `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/attack]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skirmisher]]

**Category** army-war-action; 




**Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Flexible Tactics|Flexible Tactics]]

* * *

Your army uses trickery, deception, and unfair tactics to attempt a devastating attack against an outflanked army. Attempt a melee Strike or a ranged Strike against the AC of a target outflanked army that is not distant.

**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Weary|Weary 2]] until the start of your next turn.

**Success** The target army becomes weary 1 until the start of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** Your attack deals no damage to the target army, which is emboldened by your failed attempt at dirty fighting. This reduces the target army's weary value by 1.
