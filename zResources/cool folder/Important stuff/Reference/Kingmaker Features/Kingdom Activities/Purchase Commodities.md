# Purchase Commodities

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/downtime]][[leadership]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




You can spend RP to Purchase Commodities, but doing so is more expensive than gathering them or relying upon trade agreements. When you Purchase Commodities, select the Commodity you wish to purchase (Food, Lumber, Luxuries, Ore, or Stone). Expend 8 RP if you're purchasing Luxuries or 4 RP if you're purchasing any other Commodity. Then attempt a basic Trade check check.

**Success** You gain 2 Commodities of the chosen type.

**Failure** You gain 1 Commodity of the chosen type.

**Critical Failure** You gain no Commodities.
