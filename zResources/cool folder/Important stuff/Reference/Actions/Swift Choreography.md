# Swift Choreography `pf2:r`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/auditory]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/linguistic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]

* * *

**Effect** You call out a quick reminder to your ally about a special move you'd suggested to them at some point in the past, allowing the ally to avoid the triggering effect completely.
