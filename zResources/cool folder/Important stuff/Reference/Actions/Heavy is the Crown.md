The weight of authority falls heavily upon you, as well as nearby creatures. All enemies in a 15-foot burst within 60 feet take spirit damage damage equal to your level with a Will check save against your class DC. Any enemy that fails its save must immediately kneel, dropping [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] as a free action.
