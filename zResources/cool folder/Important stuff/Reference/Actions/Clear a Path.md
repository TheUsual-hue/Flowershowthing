# Clear a Path `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Gunslinger]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You're wielding a two-handed firearm or two-handed crossbow.

* * *

You push outward with your weapon to clear some space before quickly reloading a fresh round. You make an Athletics check to [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Actions/Skill Actions/Shove|Shove]] an opponent within your reach using your weapon, then Interact to reload. For this Shove, you don't need a free hand, and you add the weapon's item bonus on attack rolls (if any) to the Athletics check. If your last action was a ranged Strike with the weapon, use the same multiple attack penalty as that Strike for the Shove; the Shove still counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks as normal.
