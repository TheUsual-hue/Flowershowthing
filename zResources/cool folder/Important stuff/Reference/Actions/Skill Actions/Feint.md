# Feint `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mental]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You are within melee reach of the target you attempt to Feint.

* * *

With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared for your real attack. Attempt a [[/act feint]]{Deception} check against your target's Perception DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** You throw your enemy's defenses against you entirely off. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.

**Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.

**Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.
