# Create a Diversion `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mental]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** interaction; 




With a [[/act create-a-diversion variant=gesture]]{gesture}, a [[/act create-a-diversion variant=trick]]{trick}, or some [[/act create-a-diversion variant=distracting-words]]{distracting words}, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits.

Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.

* * *

**Success** You become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [[Sneak|Sneak]] away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the Stealth skill to Hide or Sneak. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.

**Failure** You don't divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
