# Tumble Through `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/move]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/skill]]

**Category** interaction; 




You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an [[/act tumble-through]]{Acrobatics} check against the enemy's Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space. You can [[Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] using Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.

**Success** You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.

**Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.
