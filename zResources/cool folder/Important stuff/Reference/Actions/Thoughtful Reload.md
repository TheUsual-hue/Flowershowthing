# Thoughtful Reload `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Gunslinger]]

**Category** interaction; 




As you sink deep into a state of analytical calm and focus on the foe before you, your hands reload a bullet instinctively. Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against an opponent you can see and then Interact to reload.
