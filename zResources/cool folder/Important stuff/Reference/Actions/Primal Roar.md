### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/auditory]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/eidolon]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your eidolon unleashes a primal roar or other such terrifying noise that fits your eidolon's form. Your eidolon attempts Intimidation checks to [[Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy that can hear the roar; these Demoralize attempts don't take any penalty for not sharing a language.
