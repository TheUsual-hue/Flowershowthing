# Bribe Contact

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/downtime]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/secret]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Cost** A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on Party Treasure by level. Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.

**Requirements** You've successfully Gained a Contact.

* * *

You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.

**Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.

**Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.
