# Patron's Presence `pf2:2`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/aura]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** A palpable weight extends from your familiar in a 15-foot emanation. Enemies who enter or start their turn within the aura must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] as long as they remain within the aura, or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] on a critical failure. The aura lasts until the end of your next turn, but the familiar can Sustain it up to 1 minute.
