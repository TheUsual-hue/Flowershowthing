# Seething Frenzy `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/eidolon]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/emotion]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/mental]]

**Category** defensive; 




Your eidolon's fury boils over into a reckless, out-of-control frenzy. While frenzied, your eidolon is affected by _boost eidolon_ and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level, but it takes a -2 penalty to AC. Your eidolon can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy.

The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which it's [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.
