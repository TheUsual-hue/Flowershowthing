# Crash Against Me `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/transcendence]]






Your skin becomes virtually unbreakable. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance equal to your level to the chosen damage type.

During this time, if a creature attacking you using a weapon dealing the same damage type as your resistance misses you or hits you but deals no damage due to your resistance, the weapon clangs wildly off your skin. This painful reverberation makes the attacking enemy [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and gives it a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with that weapon until the start of the enemy's next turn.
