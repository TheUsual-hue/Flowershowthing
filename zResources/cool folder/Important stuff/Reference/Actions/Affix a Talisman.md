# Affix a Talisman

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/exploration]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/manipulate]]






**Requirements** You must use a [[Equipment/Repair Toolkit|Repair Toolkit]]

* * *

You spend 10 minutes affixing a talisman to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair toolkit with both hands. You can also use this activity to remove a talisman. Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
