# Sustain an Effect

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




You Sustain one effect with a sustained duration while moving at half speed. Most such effects can be sustained for 10 minutes, though some specify they can be sustained for a different duration. Sustaining an effect that requires making complex decisions, such as _spectral weapon_, can make you [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], as determined by the GM.
