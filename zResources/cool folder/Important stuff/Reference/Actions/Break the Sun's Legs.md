# Break the Sun's Legs `pf2:2`

You make a slashing motion over the brightest source of light, whether it's a torch or the sun in the sky. A gash appears over the light source, visible to all, and devours the light. The entire area within a 120-foot burst around you is affected by a 9th-rank [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Darkness|Darkness]] spell for 1 minute. The stolen light is channeled to your eyes, granting you greater darkvision for the duration of the effect.
