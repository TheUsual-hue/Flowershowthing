# Only You and I `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/transcendence]]






You draw your foe into a fated conflictâ€”one you know you'll win. Choose an enemy within your reach. Until the end of your next turn, that enemy gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls it makes against you, but it must attempt a Will check save against your class DC whenever it tries to move away from you, Strike a target other than you, or Cast a Spell that doesn't include you as a target. On a failure, the action or actions related to the failed attempt is disrupted. Whenever the enemy misses you with a Strike while this effect is active, you heal 1d8+5 healing Hit Points.
