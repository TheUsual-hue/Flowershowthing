By discussing plans for your future kingdom with them and describing the benefits of your rule, you can attempt to soothe their spirits.

Regardless of the result, that knight gains the benefits of the Refocus activity (if they have a focus pool) but is temporarily immune to Royal Grace for 24 hours.
