### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/flourish]]

**Category** offensive; 




Either Stride twice or attempt an Acrobatics check check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing up to twice your Speed on a rope or similar object, then Strike.

If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, the Strike deals one additional weapon damage die.
