# Raconteur's Reload `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Gunslinger]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your rapid or forceful words draw the enemy's attention away from your hands long enough to chamber another bullet. Interact to reload and then attempt a Deception check to [[Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] or an Intimidation check to [[Demoralize|Demoralize]].
