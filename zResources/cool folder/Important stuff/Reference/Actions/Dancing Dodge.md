# Dancing Dodge `pf2:r`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/move]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** You're hit by a Strike during the first round of combat

**Effect** You take advantage of the fact that your foe isn't ready to anticipate your dance-like moves in combat. Add a +3 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering Strike to determine the Strike's actual result.
