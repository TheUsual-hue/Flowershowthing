# Detect Magic

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




You cast [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] at regular intervals. You move at half your travel speed or slower. You have no chance of accidentally overlooking a magic aura at a travel speed up to 300 feet per minute, but must be traveling no more than 150 feet per minute to detect magic auras before the party moves into them.
