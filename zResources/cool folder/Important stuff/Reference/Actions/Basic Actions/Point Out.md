# Point Out `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/auditory]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/manipulate]][[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/visual]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** A creature is undetected by one or more of your allies but isn't undetected by you.

* * *

You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to your allies, rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]]. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's Stealth DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
