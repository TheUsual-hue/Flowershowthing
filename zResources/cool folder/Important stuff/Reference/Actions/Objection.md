# Objection `pf2:r`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/fortune]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You're about to attempt a saving throw against a linguistic effect

* * *

**Effect** Your devil's eye crackles with infernal glee as you discover a loophole in the wording of the triggering effect. You roll your saving throw twice, taking the higher result.
