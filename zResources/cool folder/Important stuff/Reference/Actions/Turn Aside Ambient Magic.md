### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/concentrate]]

**Category** defensive; 




Your ostilli glows a faint yellow as it establishes a barrier. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain resistance against the chosen damage type equal to half your level.
