**Requirements** Your lantern light is shining

**Effect** Your lenses focus your light into a searing beam. You deal 5d4 fire damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line, with a Reflex check saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. Your lantern light then extinguishes, and you can't use this ability or use your lantern light again for 1d4 rounds. At 11th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.
