# Blinding of the Needle `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/transcendence]]






You aim your weapon in a superficial cut above your opponent's eye. Make a Strike with the imbued ikon. If that Strike is successful, the target must succeed at a Fortitude check save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to clear the blood from its vision.
