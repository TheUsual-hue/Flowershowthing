**Category** interaction; 




**Trigger** You roll a skill check or saving throw and don't like the result.

Destiny, fate, or some other force bends around you as your mythic power swells, manifesting in a flash of light or visible surge of energy emanating from your body as you cast aside the chains of fate. You expend a Mythic Point and reroll the check or save with mythic proficiency, taking the new result.
