# Liberating Step `pf2:r`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Reference/Classes/Champion]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** An enemy damages, [[Conditions/Grabbed|grabs]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|restrains]] your ally, and both are in your champion's aura

* * *

You free an ally from restraint.

If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level.

The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilizing]], or [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzing]] them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to [[Escape|Escape]] from one effect as a free action.

If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn't need to escape.
