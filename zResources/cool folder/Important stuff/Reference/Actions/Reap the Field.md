# Reap the Field `pf2:1`

### [[cool folder/Important stuff/Bestiary/zz_traits/transcendence]]






**Requirements** Your previous action was a successful Strike with the [[Mortal Harvest|Mortal Harvest]]

* * *

**Effect** Time seems to lag as you blur across the battlefield, deciding the fate of many in a moment. Stride up to half your Speed and make another melee Strike with the mortal harvest against a different creature.

This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as your previous Strike, but counts toward your multiple attack penalty as normal.
