  - name: "Telepathic Link"
    desc: " (mental,occult) A rider who would tame a shotalashu for a mount must first form a telepathic link with it. Establishing this link require spending a week with the desired mount and succeeding at a DC 21 Occultism check check. Any creature with telepathic capabilities, such as telepathy, touch telepathy, empathic sense, or the ability to cast spells such as [[Spells/Telepathy|Telepathy]], gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. This link remains and neither can form a new link until one member dies. The shock of a partner dying leaves the survivor [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 24 hours and prevents forming a new link for at least a month."
