  - name: "Crush Throat"
    desc: "  When a creature fails a save against the holdfast's Constrict, the creature's throat is held tight, stopping them from speaking as long as they're [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]].

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
