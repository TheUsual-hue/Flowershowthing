  - name: "Static Field"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The storm snake gathers all static electricity in the area before releasing it in a 30-foot emanation that deals 3d12 electricity damage to all non-plant creatures (DC 19 Reflex check save) and grants plant creatures 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute. Plant life in the area begins to grow significantly faster than the average for plants of their genus; in forests, fields, or otherwise floral locations, this immediately transforms the area into non-magical difficult terrain. The storm snake can't use Static field again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Static Field|Effect: Static Field]]"
