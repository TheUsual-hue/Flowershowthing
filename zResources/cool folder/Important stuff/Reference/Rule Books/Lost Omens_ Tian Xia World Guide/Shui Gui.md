    desc: "  A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-rank _[[Spells/Darkness|Darkness]]_ spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Greater Darkvision|Greater Darkvision]], however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness."

The shui gui then returns to life at the edge of its body of water as if it had been the target of a successful resurrect ritual, except it has the appearance of the target rather than its original body. After a week, the spirit of the drowned creature becomes a shui gui. The new spirit can't be raised from the dead by normal magical means until they've been destroyed as a shui gui."

    desc: "  A shui gui can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] corporeal creatures despite being incorporeal.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
