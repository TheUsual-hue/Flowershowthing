Though not every commoner is downtrodden, many live hard lives of toil as they work to keep their families fed and housed in relative comfort. While many commoners are just simple folks who keep to themselves, sometimes commoners rebel, either rising up to face their oppressors or persuaded or even duped into joining nefarious plans and criminal conspiracies. Commoners benefit from power in numbers, and a crowd of commoners can accomplish a great deal more than their rulers often expect.

Unfortunately, every society has people living on its fringes. While good communities work to grant aid and respite to their downtrodden, sometimes-due to economic downturn, famine, or war-the ranks of the less fortunate exceed the community's capacity to support them. In heartless neutral and evil societies, poverty is seen as an inevitability that can never be truly eradicated, or even worse, as a tool to be manipulated for political gain.
