While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide pointers and lead drills that ensure your newer colleagues' attacks strike true. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump's modifier to attack rolls to 2.

**Normal**: A Level Bump increases a PC's attack roll modifiers by 1.

**Special**: A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
