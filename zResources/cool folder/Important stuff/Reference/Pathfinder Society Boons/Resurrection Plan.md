# Resurrection Plan

### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Service\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 0 with any faction

**Cost** 25 Fame ([[Resurrect|Resurrect]]) or 50 Fame ([[Raise Dead|Raise Dead]])

* * *

**Effect** The Pathfinder Society is invested in keeping its most successful agents in the field. You can purchase a [[Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual for 25 Fame. If you are in a rush to return to life and cannot wait the day for this ritual to be conducted, you can instead purchase a casting of the [[Raise Dead|Raise Dead]] spell for 50 Fame.

**Special** This reward can be purchased multiple times, as it strictly represents the ability to secure the listed services.
