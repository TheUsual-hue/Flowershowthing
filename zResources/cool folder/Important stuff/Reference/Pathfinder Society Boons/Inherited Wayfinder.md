A more experienced Pathfinder agent has provided you a wayfinder, a magical compass that also serves as an informal badge of the Pathfinder Society. This agent might have purchased the wayfinder for you, bequeathed their own wayfinder before retiring, or secured the device for you through other means. You gain a wayfinder (Pathfinder Core Rulebook page 617). This wayfinder has an effective price of 0 gp for the purpose of resale.
