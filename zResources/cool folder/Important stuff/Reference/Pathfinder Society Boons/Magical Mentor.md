While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide key spellcasting insights that augment your colleagues' magic. Any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours can prepare one additional spell of their highest-level spell slot or cast one additional spell of their highest-level spell slot. When casting spells of a magical tradition that is the same as the tradition you use for spellcasting, the affected PC also increases the Level Bump's modifier to spell DCs to 2.

**Normal**: A Level Bump increases a PC's spell DCs by 1, and it does not grant any additional spells prepared or spell slots.

**Special**: A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
