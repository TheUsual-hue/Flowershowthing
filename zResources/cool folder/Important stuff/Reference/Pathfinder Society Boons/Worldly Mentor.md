While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you help your less experienced colleagues recognize danger and withstand danger. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump's modifier to Perception checks and Initiative rolls to 2.

**Normal**: A Level Bump increases a PC's Perception modifier by 1.

**Special**: A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
