While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you shield your more fragile wards from the threat of death. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase their current and maximum Hit Points by an additional amount equal to 3 times your Radiant Oath reputation tier (Liked = 1, Admired = 2, Revered = 3).

**Normal**: A Level Bump increases a PC's Hit Points by 10% or 10, whichever is higher.

**Special**: A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
